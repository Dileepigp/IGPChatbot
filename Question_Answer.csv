"""I'm having  a meeting  with  my school  counselor  on LoRs,  what  should  I discuss  with","You should be prepared to discuss which two teachers you plan to ask for letters of  recommendation, as well as why you will be asking those teachers. You should be able  to articulate your goals for college and beyond, and what experiences youve had that  will support those goals. You should be prepared to discuss how you feel youve taken  advantage  of your  schools  resources  (classes,  extracurriculars,  teachers,  etc) to support  your interests and goals, as your counselors recommendation is designed to articulate  exactly these qualities about you."
"After  the final  review,  will the counselor  provide  me with  detailed  feedback?  What  is  the form  of feedback? Such as a written report, one -on-one talk, etc.?","The final  review  feedback  will be provided  via Genie.  Typically,  the FAO  will provide  a  brief written outline of the feedback as well as direct edits to the activity list and  essays as needed."
Any free resources  that  can help  me self-study  a certain  course?,"InGenius  Prep offers a tutorial program. School teachers have office hours where  students  can meet  with  their  teachers  to get extra  help.  Teachers  can also identify  other  students who are excellent in a subject, like math or science, and can tutor their fellow  students. Some students prefer peer academic tutoring to meeting with teachers."
Are residential  programs  better?,"Residential programs offer students the opportunity to experience life on a college  campus, which can have a significant impact on a students perspective. However, they  are not deemed  better  than  virtual  programs  if an in-person  program  is unaffordable   or inaccessible. Residential programs mostly benefit the students and not their  admission prospects."
Are summer  programs  in other  countries  not as good  as those  in the U.S.?,"Top summer programs are located in the United States, especially since that is also  where  they  are most  popular.  Alternatively,  there  are good  options  in the UK, Canada ,  and Australia , if those are more accessible to a student."
"Are summer  programs  worth  the cost,  and can I get financial  aid?","Evaluate the cost of a program according to a set budget, as many programs are  affordable while others are set at very high costs. If financial aid is an important factor,  then  make  a list exclusive  of programs  that offer  scholarships  and need -based  aid. Keep  in mind that application deadlines for those requesting aid are often earlier than the  latest deadline option. Also, most virtual programs are more affordable than residential  programs, since room and board are not included in the total cost."

Are there  opportunities  for lab research  with  some  programs?,"Some summer programs, especially research -focused ones like MITs Research Science   Institute (RSI)  or UCSBs Research Mentorship Program , provide direct lab experience. Others  may include STEM courses with lab components. We can help you evaluate how hands -on the program is based on your childs interests. Students have also been successful reaching out  directly to professors and PhD researchers at local colleges, offering their assistance on  ongoing  projects.  These  positions  are coveted,  so students  must  be resourceful  and persistent!  Strong  opportunities  are available  here,  on our blog  titled  STEM  Summer  Camps  A Look  at the  Top Programs ."

Can I apply  for a less competitive  major  first and then  switch  majors  after   entering university?,"Ingenius  Prep  acknowledges  that this is a common  question,  but advises  caution    While  it's often  possible  to switch  majors,  it's not guaranteed,  especially  in competitive   programs.    Students  should  research  the university's  policies  on major  transfers,  including  any GPA   requirements or deadlines.  This is on a case by case  basis. For the most part, switching majors IS possible. There is a  distinct difference  between  profile  themeapplication  strategy  and intended  majorcareer  goal.   It will be important for the studentfamily to discuss their specific goalsneeds with their IGP  team."
"Can I apply  to different  majors  at different  schools?  For example,  can I apply  for  Computer Science at University A and Economics at University B?","For the majority  of campuses  that use the common  application,  there  is a Future  Plans  section where you can include information about your future career interests. We encourage   our students  to be as specific  as possible  here,  and to make  sure  their  future plans align with  their activities list and coursework.   Under each campuss supplementary materials, there will be a section where you either declare  a specific major, or express an academic area of interest. Technically, you could choose entirely  different majors for each school. But at Ingenius, we work hard to craft a cohesive application  narrative for our students, that showcases their passion, how they developed said passion, and  how they hope to make an impact in the future. Thus, it is important to keep the major of  interest consistent across all campuses, to make sure we are communicating that core story  behind who the applicant is and what they can contribute. There may be slight variations in  major declaration based on what each campus  provides,  but for the most  part,  we strongly  urge   students  to stick  to a core  major."
Can I apply  to only  one school  in the UK?,Can I apply  to only  one school  in the UK?
Can I apply  to two majors  at the same  university?  Does  that count  as one school  or two?,"Some universities may allow students to apply to dual majors or a combination of  majorminor, depending on what their program offers. We typically recommend students to   pursue  majors  that are interdisciplinary,  bringing  together  seemingly  disparate  areas  of study  together in a unique way, which speaks highly of the students character and their intellectual  curiosity."
Can I audit  or participate  in the program  in any way?,"At InGenius,  we give our students  the best  opportunity  to demonstrate  independence  and  maturity to their mentors so that they can succeed in their research and earn a letter of  recommendation.      To give our students  the best  opportunity  to impress  their  Academic  Mentor,   only students and instructors should participate in mentorship meetings.    InGenius  Progress  Managers  will keep  parents  updated  and pass  on any feedback  during the program."
"Can I choose  a teacher  who  is very  close  to me, even  if I'm not doing  too well in that  subject?","Yes! These teachers can often provide the best recommendations. The teacher for the  class in which you got the easy A without ever participating wont be able to speak to  who  you are as a student,  how  you learn,  and how  you deal  with  subjects  and topics  you  struggle with. On the other hand, if youre working very closely with a teacher for a class  in which  youre  struggling,  that teacher  is going  to be able  to speak  to your  perseverance  and determination to overcome obstacles and learn what you need to in order to  succeed in the class. The teachers that know you well will be able to more convincingly  speak to your strengths and motivations. That said, this can depend on what not doing  too well means - something like a B or B is likely not an issue. If youre earning a C in  the course, however, the teacher may not be able to write as strong a recommendation  (though this depends on what your overall academic profile looks like, as well). Speak to  your counseling team if you have any questions about whether or not a teacher would  make an appropriate recommendation."
Can I choose  my major  based  on the subject  I perform  best  in during  high school?,"Yes, this is often  a good  indicator  of a good  major.  However,  colleges  offer  far more  majors  than  classes offered in high school, so you will want to explore the major options that are related to  the subjects youve enjoyeddone well in during high school."
Can I choose  my schools  first and then  create  the list? Can I finalize  the schools  I want  to apply  to and then create the final application list based on those schools?,"You can come to us with an initial list of schools you are interested in applying to, but we also  may suggest additional campuses, or suggest removing certain campuses based on academic   and extracurricular  fit. Ingenius  requires  our students  to have  a healthy  balance of reach, target,  and safety -school campuses."
Can I create  my own  school  list?,"We will give ample recommendations on a students school list, but ultimately, the final say is  on the student and their parents. Though based on our requirement of including reach,   target,  and safety  school  campuses,  deviating  from  that requirement  may  require more  conversations with our team."
Can I finalize  the list of schools  I want  to apply  to and include  it in the contract?,Can I finalize  the list of schools  I want  to apply  to and include  it in the contract?
Can I have  three  subject  teachers  writing  the letter  for me?,"Yes, you can have three subject teachers writing a letter of recommendation for you,  though, again, less is more when it comes to supplemental materials. Check to make  sure the university youre applying to will accept supplemental letters. Make sure the   third teacher has a unique perspective on you and will be able to write about you in a  new way, and its possible that they will make a strong supplemental letter of  recommendation.  Speak  to your  counseling  team  to ensure  that the perspective  from   this third teacher will be sufficiently different from the first two."
Can I quit the course  after  I start?,"If you decide  to quit the course,  you will forfeit  your course credit."
Can I retake the AP test if I didn't do well?,"Yes, but often this is not the best use of your time.  Other  things  that you could  do to  enhance  your  college  application  could  move  the needle more in an admission decision.   7) How  to send  AP scores  to schools?   8) What  AP scores  can be reported  and which  ones  can not?"
Can I send  scores  separately  for verbal  and math?,You can report  the scores  separately for  schools  that allow  you to superscore.  When   you send  these  scores  to prove  that you are correctly reporting your scores the college  will see the full test sitting scores but can only consider the scores you reported for  superscoring.
Can I swap the course to other course?,"Once a students enrollment in a program  course  is confirmed,  the student  is fully   committed  to joining  the course.  Once  the course begins, the student may not join the  same or different course later. Failure to complete the course will result in forfeiture of  the course credit."
Can I switch  to a different  major  in college?,"Yes, most  colleges  allow  students  to change  their  major,  but the process  and requirements  vary. Students should consult the university's academic advising office for  details."
Can I take  the SAT every  month?,"March,  May,  June,  August,  September,  October, November, December are the  only months the test is offered."
Can I talk to any alumni of the program to get their insights?,"On a case by case  basis, we can consider arranging such a meeting. However, such meetings   have  not occurred  frequently  because  they  have  not been  necessary  - for the reason that  learning about other students projects can actually achieve an effect contrary to what is  desired as it tends to narrow students perspectives on what they should do or can be done,  because they could develop a tendency to follow in the   model of the project that they heard about."
Can I translate  the letter  myself?,"No, any translations  will need  to be officially  certified."
Can SAT be used  for universities  in the UKAustraliaCanadaSingaporeNew  Zealand?,Yes. But it varies by university so its best to check the university you are applying to.
Can SAT scores  be superscored?,Yes.
"Can XXX university  allow  to transfer  XXX major  (CS, engineering,  business,  etc.)   after freshman year?","Ingenius  Prep  notes  that policies  on transferring  majors  vary  significantly  between   universities.  Students should    Carefully  review  the university's  official  website or  contact the  admissions  office for   specific details.    Inquire  about  any restrictions,  GPA  requirements,  or application  processes  for  transferring  majors.    Be in touch  with  their  IGP team  for expertise  on how  to optimize  chances   for admission  into particular selective universities.    Keep in mind that the first two years of an undergrad education are typically  devoted to general education  (GE)  requirements  with  the majority,  if not all  major  specific  coursework  occurring  during junior and senior year. Therefore, it  is quite common for students to switch majors in colleges.  Some  specialized  programs  (e.g.  CS) at select  campuses  will require  students  to  directly  apply  as their intended major from the start so the student should  discuss with their IGP team for chancing and best approach based on their  unique needs."
"Can you provide  detailed  information  about  the schools?  For example,  school   rankings,  majors offered, admission requirements, campus environment, etc.","We will provide  all this information  and more  about  various  campuses,  trying  to find the best  fit for our students in terms of additional factors such as major selections, geographic  location, and availability for research and internship opportunities."
Can you provide  examples  of successful  essays  or narratives  written  by past participants?,"We have  had students  from  our course  receive  prizes  in most  of the above  contests,  and  many have ultimately been accepted into top ten universities."
Could  you help  arrange  the school  visits?,"We dont  directly  arrange  school  visits.  However,  Ingenius  Prep's  counselors  offer   personalized  guidance and may assist with visit planning as part of their  comprehensive counseling services."
Could  you recommend  some  schools?,Could  you recommend  some  schools?
Do admissions  officers  prefer  the SAT or the ACT?,"No, both are accepted across the board, however if you need to qualify for specific  admissions  criteria  you should  always  check  with  the colleges  since  the ACT is changing  and now specific sections of the test may be required by certain colleges."
Do colleges  prefer  certain  courses  over  others  for my intended  major?,"Absolutely. The courses taken in high school demonstrate an applicants interest and  preparedness  for college  or university  curricula.  For example,  if an applicant  who  intends  to major in a STEM -related major, engineering or computer science, if they have not  taken calculus in high school, that applicant will not be ready to handle the math  required for those majors."
Do I have to be a leader or founder of extracurricular activity?,"Students  should  aspire  to become  a leader  in 2-3 different  activities  by the time  they reach  the 12th grade and, if possible, they should try to create their own activity, organization, or  initiative that reflects their interests and makes an impact on their community. However, it is  not always necessary to found a new organization - such initiatives are only valuable if they  meet a true community need and demonstrate impact."
Do I need  to attend  a summer  program?,"No, students do not need to attend a summer program to make an impact over their  summer  break.  If a student  has chosen  not to attend  a summer  program,  then  they  will  need to plan ahead to ensure the break is still meaningful. Alternatives may include  service  projects,  independent  research,  paid  work,  job shadowing,  andor  developing  a  passion project with potential to scale for wider impact."
Do I need  to take  XX course  to fulfill  the prerequisites  for xx major,"Depending on the intended major, yes. Most college and university engineering  programs  begin  with  college  calculus,  which  is usually  more  rigorous  than  high  school  calculus."
"Do I need a 1550 to get into Ivy League universities (Conversely, if I don't score 1550,  am I have  no chance  at Ivy Leagues)?","No, you dont  NEED  this score;  its just helpful  in improving your chances of getting  admitted. You are not doomed without a 1550, you just need to pass the universitys  threshold for acceptable scores and then the rest is riding on other aspects of your  application."
Do I need to find a test preparation agency for the SAT? Which agencies can you  recommend?,In most  cases  youll  need  professional  help  to reach  top scores.   I can recommend our services here at InGenius Prep.
Do programs  have  specific  requirements  for recommendation  letters?,"Yes some  request  a letter  from  a STEM  teacher  or school  counselor,  for example.  Programs  will usually  state  whether  the letter  should  address  academic  ability,  character,  or both.  We can  help choose the right recommenders and guide them. A good rule of thumb is to select a  teacher from your current or most recent academic year whom you are positive is enthusiastic  about  your  candidacy;  follow  up with  a short  cover  letter  to assist  your  writer  in producing  a  recommendation customized to the program and your strengths."
Do schools  have  specific  requirements  for SAT verbalmath?,This varies  by school  and its best to check each schools requirements individually.
Do summer  programs  require  an F-1 visa?,"International students requiring an F -1 visa to travel and legally stay in the U.S. should  prioritize programs offering the visa to their pre -college students, since many programs  do not provide  one.  Alternatively,  international  students  can consider  virtual  programs   as an alternative."

Do you have  students  who  have  gotten  off of the waitlist?,Of course!  Insert  company  WL results  from  previous  years
Do you have recordings of these course?,"Classes are not recorded automatically; if a student  knows  they  will miss  the class,  they   should  inform  the instructor  at least  24 hours in advance of the class meeting. The  instructor can record the class for them."
"Do you offer  advice  on school  selection?  Will you recommend  suitable  schools   based  on my academic performance, interests, and hobbies?","Yes we do! Our former admissions officers will review your academic  performance via grades,  APIBSATACT  scores,  as well as your  various   extracurricular  activities.  We will typically recommend a healthy balance of  reach schools, target schools that generally align with your fulfilled  academicEC requirements, and safety schools as back -up options."
Do you offer  guidance  on interview  preparation?,"Yes! We offer mock interviews, which you can register for here . Additionally, you may wish  to watchlisten  to this podcast  on acing  the interview  with  former  CMU  admissions  officer   Mustafa Hasnain!"
Do you offer  guidance  on major  selection?,Of course! This goes hand -in-hand with school list decisions and the overall strategy of the   entire  application.  Major  selection  is a major  step  in being  able  to develop  a students  application persona and cohesion within their entire application. We work with students very  intentionally on their major selection so they are choosing an option that they have  passionexcitement for and that also connects to the rest of the application.
Do you organize  school  visits  for students?,"We will help students choose cities and schools they want to visit. Nowadays, every school   will have  an online  system  for registering  for events  (virtual  or in person).  While we typically  wont register a student for these events, we will absolutely help with the structure of the  college visit."
Does  applying  to humanities  majors  easier  for college  admissions?,"Ingenius  Prep  clarifies  that applying  to humanities  majors  is not necessarily  always  easier.    Admissions  committees  evaluate  applicants  holistically,  considering  all aspects  of their   application, including academic record, extracurricular involvement, essays, and  recommendations.    Highly  selective  colleges  have  competitive  admissions  standards  across  all majors,   including  the humanities.     In general,  students  in impacted  applicant  pools  (e.g.  CSengineering,  health  sciences,  business)   will face stiffer competition with students that tend to have higher GPA averages and test  scores.. At the same time, students should not assume that a humanitiesnon -STEM approach  is the best route to optimize their chances of admission. Consulting and leveraging the  expertise of their IGP team is the best way to get clarity on what their next best steps are based  on their profile and admissions goals."

Also  remember  that APs can give you college   credit  and allow you to enter more advanced courses when you get to college."

This will allow you to most closely approximate the experience of  interviewing with the university or a third -party. You should also review this list  of  frequently asked questions in the interview process and review your responses for each.  As youre practicing, make sure you flesh out your responses. Try to anticipate the  follow up question the interviewer will ask and make sure to answer that in your  response as well. If the question is, What is your favorite subject? for example, dont  just say, Math, and stop talking - explain why math is your favorite subject! It is also  a  good  idea  to review  your  application  to the school  youre  interviewing  with  ahead  of  time  to ensure youre able to talk comfortably about what you discussed in your  application.

How  do Io determine  if a summer  program  is prestigious  enough?,"Selectivity, faculty involvement (opportunities for mentorship!), and the reputation of host  institutions are good indicators. Programs run by top universities or those with competitive admissions (low acceptance rates, application essays, recommendations) tend to carry more  weight.  Longer  programs  often  offer  more  meaningful  experiences,  but those  with  short   duration can certainly be useful, too ( Yale Young Global Scholars  is a good example, and its  only two weeks). But remember  how you use the opportunity matters more than the name  alone.   Admission  officers  can see through  involvement  in cookie -cutter  programs,  so you must  be able  to explain how it fits into your overall profile! Heres a starter list of 22 Summer Programs That   Count ."
"How  do you differentiate  between  reach,  match,  and safety  schools?  Will you use a  specific method  to mark  them,  making  it easier  for me to distinguish  during  the application  process?","At IngeniusPrep, we take a students GPA and test scores to calculate a student score. Using  this, as well as ample data from prior admissions cycles, our online platform, titled The Genie,  automatically sorts colleges into high reach, reach, target, and safety categories for  each of our students. While our former admissions officers will provide initial  school   suggestions  keeping  in mind  traditionally  reach,  target,  and safety  campuses based on  acceptance rate, the actual rating assigned to each campus per student is determined by this  internal calculation."
How  do you evaluate  whether  a school  is a good  fit for my child?,"Evaluating  whether  a school  is a good  fit for your  child  should  be about  more  than  the  rankings. Its about how well the school aligns with your childs    Academic  Needs  strong  programs  in your  childs  area  of interest,  class   format  (discussion -based vs. lecture -based) formats, student to faculty  ratio,  opportunities  for research,  internships,  study  abroad,  etc.,  and  support  services    Desired  Career  Support   Outcomes  job placement  rates,  career   services,  opportunities for internships    Social   Emotional  Needs  size,  location  (urban,  suburban,  rural,   proximity  to home), campus culture and housing options (on -campus  vs off -campus, dorm  quality, availability), student support services  (medical and mental health)    Financial  Needs  Affordability  is important   opportunities  for financial   aid and overall cost vs. budget    Talking  to your  child  and gauging  their  preferences  and needs  is important    have  open  conversations with them often!    Conducting  school  research  with  the relevant  criteria  in mind  and keeping  track   of it in a spreadsheet or other centralized document is important!"
How  do you help  the student  to find hisher  niche  focus  in a broad  major?,"Look  at specializations  together  talk to experts  in the field,  conduct  your  own  research,  and  use college websites to explore the different fields within broader majors."

How  does  the Global  Network  for RecruitmentCollaboration  work?  Can you give an  example?,"It's designed  to help  students  connect  with  others  for the purpose  of recruiting  team  members for their own projects and collaborating with other students on projects or  initiatives.     The LIL program facilitates these connections through various means, such as   Active  Curation  LIL instructors  actively  connect  students  with  shared  interests or  complementary skills.    Student  Organization  Marketplace  This platform  plays  a role in connecting  students with existing organizations or those seeking collaborators.    LIL Events  Events  like the Showcase  or Speaker  Series  provide  opportunities for  students to network and find collaborators.     Example   The slides provide an example of how LIL instructors facilitate collaboration    Student 1 is interested in biologyhuman anatomy and community service.    Student 2 is interested in STEM, medicine, and teaching.    LIL instructors connect them and suggest a collaboration Student 1 could fundraise  for  their  community  service  by designing  anatomy -themed  stickers,  and Student 2 could  feature Student 1 as a guest speaker on their podcast to discuss human anatomy and  promote the stickers.     This example  illustrates  how  the Global  Network,  facilitated  by LIL, can lead  to mutually  beneficial partnerships that enhance both students' projects and provide them with valuable  collaborative experiences."

Potentially  earn a Letter of Recommendation from their mentor.    Show your published paper to the college.    Write  about  your research  experience in  your college  application essays."
How  does  this program  specifically  help  me develop  leadership  skills?  Are there any  real-life examples?,"This program puts students into real -world situations by helping them experience  entrepreneurship  and leadership  settings  first hand.  In the duration  of the LIL program, they   launch  their  own  project,  venture,  organization  andor  business.  By going  through the real  process of creating something of their own that wasnt there before, students are necessarily  learning those essential skills that cannot be learned otherwise.     Most  students  do not do these  projects  solo,  nor do we encourage  them  too. We always  encourage  students  to recruit  where  possible  to work  in a team  to build  their  project.  We think  - and so do admissions officers at top universities - that there is no better way to prove   leadership  ability  than  to have  successfully  convinced  ones  peers  to help  in ones chosen  endeavor.     You can see many  testimonies  from  LIL Alumni  that have  gained  admissions  to prestigious  universities here .

How  long  does  it take  to complete  an Academic  Mentorship?,InGenius  offers  different  scheduling  options  from  which  students  can choose.      Most InGenius Academic Mentorships take between 10 -14 weeks to complete.    Students  usually  have  weekly  meetings  with  their  Academic  Mentor  and  Teaching Assistant.    Group  Academic  Mentorships  follows  a fixed  schedule  (10 weeks  in summer;  12 weeks  outside summer)    1v1 Academic  Mentorship  offers  more  flexible  scheduling  to suit individual  student needs.    Some  students  choose  an accelerated  program  while  others  may  prefer  to  extend their programs over a longer period.
How  long  does  it take  to prepare  for the summer  school  application?,"Depending on the application requirements, a summer school application may take as  quickly  as a few days  or as long  as a couple  of months.  Its critical  to plan  accordingly  by  creating a timeline with key task items to stay on top of deadlines."
How  long  does  it take  to take  the SAT?,"The standard  SAT takes  2 hours  and 14 minutes to complete, not including the 10 - minute break between the   Reading  and Writing  and Math  sections,  for a total  of 2 hours  and 24 minutes."
How  long  should  a summer  program  be?,"Summer  programs  dont  have  to be a specific  length  to be meaningful.  If a student  can  effectively  immerse  themselves  in a valuable  learning  experience,  that is what  matters  most. Often exploratory programs are scheduled for one to two weeks; while more  intensive, research programs can be upwards of eight weeks."
How  long  will the interview  last?,"Typically, interviews with a university will last about half an hour. Depending on the  particular interviewer  you have,  they  can last between  15 minutes  and an hour.   InitialView  interviews  are 12 -15 minutes long."
How  many  LoRs  do I need?,"Generally  speaking,  you will need  two letters  of recommendation  from  teachers,  as  well as  the letter  from  your  school  guidance  counselor.  Particular  schools  may  have   different requirements, however. The University of California system does not accept  letters of recommendation, for example. Planning to provide two LoRs (in addition to  the counselor letter) will ensure youve got everything you need, however!"
How  many  rounds  of final  review  are there  for the application  forms?  What  is the  focus  of each round?,There  is one official  final  review  for each  application.  This will be the FAOs  opportunity  to  provide a comprehensive review of the full application.
How  many  rounds  or revision  are needed  for supplemental  essays?,"Most  strong  essays  go through  at least  two or three  rounds  of thoughtful  revision.  The first  draft is just the beginning  refining tone, structure, and depth is where the magic happens.   Reflections  on your  personal  and academic  goals  that are truly  persuasive  and moving  cannot  be written at the last minute! See InGenius resources here  on our blog."
How  many  summer  programs  should  I apply  to?,"Applying  to at least  three  summer  programs  is ideal;  though  the list should  include   reach, target, and safety options. If not, then consider applying to one or more  additional programs to be sure you have a program to attend."
How  many  summer  programs  should  I apply  to?,"Most students apply to three to five programs to ensure a mix of Reach, Target, and Safety  options. Focus on quality applications rather than quantity, and be sure each program aligns  with  your  goals.  Applying  broadly  can reduce  stress  while  still allowing  for intentional  choices."
How  many  supplemental  essays  do I need  to write?,It depends  on your  list. Some  programs  require  just one;  others  (like  YYGS ) might  have  five or  more. We help map out a smart writing calendar to make the process manageable.
How  many  times  do I need  to take  the SAT?,We recommend  at least  twice  so you can super score if needed. You can take it as  many times as you like though.
How  many  times  should  I take  the SAT or ACT?,As many  times  as you need  to in order  to hit your  goal  score.  You will usually  hit a point  of diminishing returns in taking the test multiple times in a row without significant  changes to your prep.
How  much  do summer  programs  typically  cost?,"Many programs are priced at several thousand USD. More robust programs that are  longer  or involve  high -level  research  may  be priced  closer  to ten thousand  USD.  That  said, many of these more expensive programs at top universities offer financial  assistance."

We offer  need -based  financial  aid for students  with  limited  budgets  on a case -by-case basis."
How  much  time  commitment  is required  outside  of the 90-minute  weekly  sessions?,"The course  requires  roughly  1 to 1.5 hours  of outside  work  per week,  and the final  essay  project requires 3 -5 hours."
How  much time  do I need  to commit each  week? Will it  affect my schoolwork?,"As with  anything  else,  the more  time  you commit  to something  the more  likely  it is to be successful.  Your projectentrepreneurial endeavor is no different.     The happy news though, is that even so it is unlikely to take up that much time. Probably   fewer  than  5 hours  a week  to ensure  the project  keeps  going  on a regular basis. There may  be certain periods, for instance leading up to an event youre organizing, where the  project is more time -consuming, but those are likely to be exceptions rather than the  norm.  As for whether it will affect your schoolwork, this is entirely a question of pre -planning and  time management. You should be able to anticipate your academic calendar (i.e. when you  have tests, when you need to be focused on preparing for APs for example), such that you can  plan your project work accordingly to avoid clashes with your academic commitments. More  importantly, as a means of proving your multitasking, time  management  and general  ability  to  elite  universities,  this will constitute  very  potent proof that you are a cut above the rest."
"How  should  I balance  the school  choices  across  different  countries?  For example,  how   many reach, match, and safety schools should I apply to in the US, UK, and Canada?","I can speak to US admissions here. For an average US school list of 12, we typically  recommend  students  apply  to 5-7 reach  campuses,  3-5 target  campuses,  and 1-3 safety school  campuses."
How  should  I choose  between  credit  and non-credit  programs?  Is it better  to  have college credit?,"Most  for-credit  courses  are reserved  for upperclassmen,  since  they  require  a higher  level  of academic  preparation  (e.g.,  Yale Summer  Session ). Nevertheless,  some  programs  do  offer courses with fewer college credits, which make them more suitable for  underclassmen (e.g., Summer at Hopkins ). While earning credit is a great achievement,  taking an undergraduate course as a rising Grade 12 student is more significant, since  the course will likely reflect an older students particular academic interest and  demonstrate their ability to perform well at the college level. Note that courses with full  college credit are often extensive, taking up a significant amount of the summer break."
How  should  I explore  summer  programs?,"While Google  is a fine place to start exploring summer programs, not all opportunities  are made equal. Carefully consider what you would like to explore or achieve over the  summer break. For example, look into  subject -specific courses if youre keen to refine  your visual art skills or learn more about bioengineering, or focus on research -based  programs  if you would  like to develop  your  academic  research  skills  or jump  into a STEM  lab. InGenius Prep has a variety of blog posts  on the subject as well as a helpful  Summer Program Recommendation Cheat Sheet  to get started."
How  should  I pick summer  school?  By university  or by major?,"Focus  on selecting  a summer  school  by academic  major,  as the quality  of the program  is  not measured by the ranking of the university."
How  should  I prepare  for the interview?,"One of the most impactful answers you can prepare is a brief (no more than one  minute) response to the prompt, Tell me a little about yourself. In this response, you  want to give the interviewer  a brief  overview  of your  main  academic  interests  and  extracurricular  activities,  as well as your goals for college and beyond. This will likely be  one of the first questions you will be asked in every interview, and giving the  interviewer a range of topics to discuss further (academics, extracurriculars, goals) can  help you control the direction of the interview to discuss specifics that you want to  highlight. Be sure youre able to articulate why youre interested in the subjects youre  interested in, as well as how the university youre interviewing with will help you  accomplish your goals. You should also be prepared to discuss potential weaknesses  that you have, as well as difficulties youve encountered to demonstrate your ability to  overcome obstacles."
How  should  I prepare  for the SAT?,"Based  on the information  in the sources  and our conversation  history,  here  is a comprehensive  guide on how to prepare for the SAT   1. Understand  the Digital  SAT Format  and Key Changes     The SAT is now  administered  in a digital  format  and is adaptive  within  each  section  (Reading  and Writing,  and Math).  Your  performance  on the first module  determines   the difficulty of the second module.    The digital  SAT is shorter , approximately  an hour  less than  the previous  paper -based  test.    The Reading  and Writing  sections  are now  blended  into one section.    A significant  change  is the focus  on single  skills  linked  to single  questions , making  it  easier to target specific areas for improvement.    The entire  Math  section  now  allows  the use of the Desmos  graphing  calculator ,  which is a powerful and underutilized tool. Developing Desmos skills is crucial for  success in math.    The scoring curve for the Reading and Writing section is steeper at the higher end ,  meaning  there's  less margin  for error  to achieve  top scores.  The Math  section's  curve  reflects the generally harder questions, allowing for more missed questions while  still achieving a good score.   2. Determine  if the SAT is the Right  Test  for You   Consider  taking  diagnostic  tests  for both  the SAT and ACT to identify  your  strengths  and weaknesses and see which format suits you better 39, 40, Our Conversation.    As a general rule, the SAT may be easier for students with strong critical thinking skills   who  might  not have  as extensive  exposure  to a broad  range  of advanced  topics.  It  emphasizes  critical  thinking  and multi -step  problem -solving  with  more  time  per  question.    The ACT tends  to favor  students  with  a broad  knowledge  base  gained  from  rigorous  coursework (like AP or IB classes) who can answer questions quickly. It also heavily  relies on reading skills across three sections.   3. Establish  a Study  Timeline      The ideal  time  to start  preparing  typically  falls in either  the 10th  or 11th  grade , after  you  have a solid foundation in the relevant math curriculum, particularly Algebra 2 for the  SAT 41, Our Conversation.    Aim for a preparation  period  of 8 to 12 weeks  for substantial  score  improvements  43,  Our Conversation. A minimum of four weeks is suggested, mainly for students already  scoring high.    Strategic  SAT test dates  to consider  include  March,  August,  and October  42, Our  Conversation. The new September SAT offers an opportunity to take the test   back -to-back  with  August  after  summer  preparation.  Be mindful  of potential  conflicts  with  academic workload for November and December test dates.   4. Implement  Effective  Study  Strategies      Prioritize Skill Building over Practice Testing Focus on mastering individual skills rather   than  just taking  numerous  practice  tests.  Practice  tests  are valuable  for measuring  progress and identifying weaknesses.    Accuracy  Before  Speed  When  building  a new  skill,  focus  on getting  questions  right  before trying to answer them quickly 21, Our Conversation.    Master  Skills  to 90  Accuracy  Aim for at least  90  accuracy  on practice  questions  for a specific skill before moving on to more difficult skills.    Targeted  Practice  Use your  diagnostic  test results  to identify  areas  where  you need  the  most improvement. Focus your study sessions on those specific skills. Utilize resources  that align with the SAT Educator"
How  should  I talk about  my strengths  and weaknesses?,"When discussing strengths, make sure you keep the conversation focused on you and  your internal processes. Do not compare yourself directly to others as a way to brag for example, if youre  the top student  in your  class,  make  sure  to talk about  all the work  you  did to become  the top  student  and what  that required  of you.  Do not talk about  how   youre  smarter  than  everyone else in your class.     When talking about weaknesses, make sure that you demonstrate there is a plan in  place to address  those  weaknesses.  If you struggle  with  time  management,  make  sure  to  also mention  the strategies youre employing to become better maybe you make very  detailed schedules now to stay on top of homework, for example. If youre able to  acknowledge your weaknesses while also demonstrating your efforts in overcoming  those weaknesses, you will be demonstrating a level of self -awareness and drive for  improvement that can be rare in high school students!"

How  to choose  an Early  Decision  II (ED II) university?,"If youre  evaluating  an ED II school,  this likely  means  that your  early  round  application(s)  did  not go as well as you had hoped or planned.    Reassess  your  top choices  Evaluate  the colleges  on your  school   list, determine which of them offer ED II, and identify your new  top choice.    Consider timing and admissions advantage ED II deadlines tend to  cluster  around  early  January,  with  decisions  by mid-February.  While  ED II  may  not offer  as significant a boost as ED I, it still demonstrates a strong  interest in a school  and can provide an admissions advantage over  Regular Decision.    Evaluate your application strength  Realize that the ED II pool may be  more  competitive  than  the Regular  Decision  pool  at some  schools,  so it is  important  to use the time  between  ED I to improve  your  grades  if  relevant  and maximize  your  extracurricular contributions."
How  to choose  Early  Action  (EA) universities?  How  many  should  we choose?,"When  deciding  between  ED vs. EA consider   Whether  you have  a clear  top choice  school  and the strength  of your   application  early in your senior year. Weight those factors against your  comfort level with  committing to a school from the onset of the  admissions process.    Consider EA if you are unsure about your top choice, want to compare  offers  from  multiple  schools,  assuming  a favorable  outcome  in at least   one admissions  process, or need the flexibility in financial aid decisions.    Remember,  Early  Action  (EA) is non-binding;  therefore  there  is no limit  on non- restrictive  EA applications. Prioritize preparing quality applications over  maximizing the number of  EA applications, and ensure a balanced mix of  schools.    Finally, consider that you can apply ED to one school and EA to other schools   simultaneously.  Given  that ED is binding,  you will have  to withdraw  your   applications  from  all other EA schools in the event that youre accepted to your  ED school. But applying to  EA schools alongside an ED application maximizes the  possibility of admission to a  school youre excited about in the event that the ED  round does not result in an  admissions decision.

How  to choose  ED1 university?,"Choosing  an Early  Decision  (ED I) school  is a significant  decision  that requires  careful   consideration. Some factors to consider include    Clear  top choice  Apart  from  ensuring  that the school  stands  out  above  all others, ensure that the school is the best fit for you  academically, socially,  culturally.    Academic readiness and overall competitiveness  Your current grades  and test scores should be within or above the schools typical range for  admitted  students.  Your  application  should  be as strong  now  as it will be  later  in the year.  ED is most  suitable  for highly  competitive  students   whose  applications  are solid  and will not benefit from additional time to  meet important milestones.    Admissions  advantage  Consider  schools  that offer  a significant   boost  in acceptance rates for ED applicants. Some schools, for  example, accept  significant portions of the incoming class from the  ED round(s).

How  to reach  out to the teacher  to request  a letter?,"You should email your teacher with a longer explanation of why youre asking them to  write your letter of recommendation and with examples of what you would like them  to highlight.  For instance,  if you have  an essay  in a course  that youre  particularly  proud   of, you should draw attention to this essay in your initial email asking for a letter of  recommendation. If you had an exciting or insightful conversation at lunch with your  teacher about a subject which interests you, thats another example of something to  draw attention to in your request for a letter of recommendation.     In this outreach,  you should  also provide  some  context  to your  recommender  about   what you hope to get from college and the application process. What do you want to  study?   What do you hope to do with an education in that area once you graduate? Dont  hesitate  to outline  these  goals  for college  and beyond  to your  recommender  so they  can provide supportive arguments and evidence in their letter.

They can work through more significant challenges during their  studentteacher conferences. If a student believes they will need even more hands -on  training than this, they should consider our 1v1 course options."

How do I decide the order of my activities on the Common Application?,"The order  of activities  should  reflect  some  combination  of the significance  of the activity to  the  applicant;  the time  spent  on the activity  (both  in terms  of years  of participation  and  hoursweek); any leadership roles associated with the activity; the relative uniqueness  of the  activity itself (e.g., common high school activities like debate might be weighted  as less  important than say, organizing a schoolwide art fair to showcase works made from recycled  materials).     The order of activities should also reflect the students application persona. For  example,  if the applicant  is an aspiring  engineer,  one would  expect  to see notable  engineering -related activities featured at the top of the list."

How does this program help improve my competitiveness in college applications?,"The Leadership  Innovation Lab program significantly enhances competitiveness in college   applications,  especially  for elite  universities,  by addressing  key factors  valued  in the admissions  process.      Cultivating  Uniqueness  The program's  core  focus  on developing  a ""signature project""  is crucial. In the realm of college applications, many activities like   summer  programs,  competitions,  and volunteering  are common,  making  it difficult for  students to truly differentiate themselves. LIL emphasizes that a signature project is  ""the only thing on your application that is entirely and uniquely you,"" providing a  platform for students to create something that genuinely reflects their individual  passions and abilities.    Demonstrating Intangible Qualities Through Action Elite universities seek students  with intangible qualities such as leadership, resilience, charisma, and initiative. LIL  recognizes that these qualities ""can only be proven through action"". By  undertaking  a  substantial  project,  students  provide  concrete  evidence  of these traits, rather than  simply claiming to possess them.    Developing  and Showcasing  Tangible  Outcomes  LIL goes  beyond  theoretical exercises,  guiding students to produce tangible outcomes. This is critical  because it allows  students to demonstrate their ability to conceive, execute, and achieve results, a key  indicator of their potential for success in college and beyond. After all - the best  prediction of the future is the past. So the best way to prove to elite universities that  you will be exceptional, is to already have been exceptional.      Providing  Comprehensive  Support  The program  offers  a wide  array  of support  mechanisms, including mentorship from experts, networking  opportunities,  funding  avenues,  and platforms  to showcase  projects.  These  resources not only aid in project development but also amplify students'  achievements, further bolstering their applications.     In essence, LIL empowers students to move beyond the ""typical profile building approach   and craft  a compelling  narrative  that highlights  their  distinctiveness  and capacity for  impact, which is precisely what elite colleges seek.       For elaboration  about  how  I explain  this,  you can check  out this webinar  I gave  from  April  httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vAFf5chnu4j8  This topic  is the main  subject  I discuss over the  whole webinar."
How long do I need to do the extracurricular activity?,"This depends on the activity. Long -term participating (multiple years) in a high school club or  organization is a good way to attain a leadership position and create impact. However, short - term opportunities, such as organizing a fundraising event, science fair, art  how,  or musical   performance  can also be a great  way to demonstrate  leadership  and impact."
How many AP tests should I take a year?,"You should max out as many AP tests as you can  fit into your  school  schedule,  but  make  sure  that this is a load  you can handle  while still succeeding in all of your school  classes."
How many honors and activities do I need for the application?,"The Common Application provides space for up to 5 honors and 10 activities, and applicants  should aspire to fill available spaces for honors and activities. This is especially  important  for  the Activities  List, which  is intended  to show  how  an applicant spends their time outside of  class, and can include a wide range of activities.     It is not necessary to include more than 5 honors and 10 activities (such as in the  additional  information  section).  The vast majority  of successful  applicants  do not use the  additional information section, and many admissions officers advise against using the   additional information section as an extension of the HonorsActivity Lists"
How many rounds of editing do I need to go through for AL?,"This depends  on the student,  but 3-5 rounds  of editing  AFTER  a full draft  of the Activity List is  complete seems reasonable."
"How will this workshop help me improve my writing skills, specifically in the context of  college applications?","Our writing class is focused on reflective writing, which is exactly the type of writing  students use for application essays. The personal statement is a 650 word reflective  essay, asking you to think about how you feel about things, how youve grown,  etc. The  reflective  writing  class  showcases  a variety  of different  types  of reflective writing."
"I am having  trouble  finishing  the test,  how  can I get faster?","Based  on the information  in the sources,  here  are several  strategies  to help  you finish  tests  faster    Understand  the Structure  and Patterns  of the Test      For the digital  SAT Reading  and Writing  section,  recognize  the general  order  of  question  types.  Vocabulary  questions  often  come  first,  followed  by more   critical thinking -based skills (referred to as the ""soggy middle"" which tends to  be more time -consuming), and then grammar, transitions, and rhetorical  synthesis questions towards the end.    Being  aware  of this pattern  can help  you strategize.  Some  students  might  choose  to tackle the easier point -earning questions first (like vocabulary and potentially  grammarrhetorical synthesis using the hack mentioned below) before diving  into the more challenging and time -consuming ""soggy middle"".    Utilize  Time -Saving  Techniques  for Specific"
I have  no academic  interests  at all. What  is my first step?,"Your  counselors  will guide  you through  this process.  You may  have  some  classes  at school  that  you prefer  to others,  which  will help  you start  to realize  disciplines  youre  interested  in. College  offers many classes beyond whats offered in high school as well, so you may discover new  disciplines that you havent taken classes in before throughout this process."

"I just want  to explore  STEM   Business,  since  it's more  potential  in the future  job  hunting. But I am not interested in doing any related ECAs.","You do need to do ECAs related to your intended major in college. So, if you dont want to do  any ECAs  related  to STEM  or business,  you likely  wont  want  to major  in those  subjects.  You can  major in a variety of subjects that will still lead to careers in business or in going to business  school if those are your goals."
"I like humanities,  but I am afraid  that it has no career  advantage  after  graduating  from  college.","There are many businesses that just like to hire smart college students, rather than looking for  particular  disciplines.  There  are also many  graduate  fields  and programs  that could  be good  fits  for humanities  majors.  Programs  like medical  school,  MBA  programs,  etc, like to see diversity  in  their students interests and expertise  they accept students from humanities majors as well."
"I read  and watch  many  materials,  but I still do not know  what  I am interested  in or I  cannot decide on one.","Often, combining interests helps us to come up with the most interesting, unique application  personas.  Talk to your  counselor  about  your  combination  of different  interests  and brainstorm  potential ways they overlap."
"If I am deferred,  what  should  I do?","Because  this deferral  will happen  so early  in the admissions  process,  you should always   entertain  this decision  and take  it seriously.  If a school  allows,  you should send in a formletter  with updated information about your academics and ECs.    You dont know what will happen, so putting in a lot of effort into your other  applications will be very important as well. You could be denied, admitted, or (rarely)  waitlisted  from  a deferral  decision,  so you dont  want  to rely on getting   a certain  result.  Do your  best  to understand  that you still have  a chance,  and  work even harder moving forward."
"If I am put on the waitlist,  do I still have  a chance  to be admitted?","Yes!  But it will very  much  depend  on the school.  Working  with  InGenius,  you can ask us this  question and we can review the schools data to find out in previous years how many students  were added to the waitlist and how many offers were given.  There  is definitely  a chance,  but it  is important  to understand  that at some schools, the chances will be much lower."
"If I have  questions  or objections  to the final  review  result,  can I communicate  with  the  counselor? Will they provide modification suggestions?",Certainly! The final review process is meant to be collaborative.  You can always ask for  clarification  from  your  FAO  and for guidance  on how  to implement  feedback  from  your  GC. Waitlist  Support

"If many  of my classmates  are joining  the same  extracurricular  activity  as me, would  that be OK?","Yes - that is not necessarily  a problem.  Becoming  a leader  in a popular  activity  or club can be a  great way to demonstrate leadership and impact. However, its also a good idea to look for  opportunities to lead or create something that reflects your unique interests.  School  List"
"If my grade  at summer  school  is not good,  would  that negatively  impact  my  college admissions?","If a summer course is taught not -for-credit, then the final grade wont be reported.  However,  the Common  Application  requires  copies  of all transcripts;  thus,  if credit   was earned  from  a university,  then  colleges  will see the final  grade  received.  While   earning an A is ideal, a B is fine for schools outside of the Ivy League."
"If the essay  is optional,  do I need  to write  it?","Yes, if you want to stand out. Optional essays are a great chance to share your voice and  demonstrate  genuine  interest.  We recommend  treating  every  optional  space  as an opportunity.  Standardized  Tests"
"Is it better  to select  a less rigorous  course  and score  an A, or a rigorous  course  and  score a B?","The idea  is for students  to aim for As in every  course  they  take.  A transcript  is taken  into  context, so there is no absolute answer to this question. In general, it is better for the  applicant to be taking higher level courses and receive a lower grade than a student  taking standard courses and receiving a lower grade."
Is it better to take an easier course to maintain a high GPA or a difficult one for rigor?,"College and university admission committees prefer transcripts that have higher -level  courses (like Advanced, Accelerated, Honors or AP designations) because having taken  these courses, students have demonstrated that they desire an academic challenge.  Applicants  to top schools  usually  have  transcripts  that are filled  with  such  courses.  So, to  be competitive  in these  applicant  pools,  a student  needs  to take  such  courses  in order  to  compete in these applicant pools."
Is it easy  to find a job if my child  graduates  from  xx program  or xx university?,"Ingenius  Prep  acknowledges  that job prospects  vary  depending  on several  factors,   including  the specific program, university reputation, economic conditions, and the  student's skills and experience. They emphasize the importance of researching  career outcomes, networking, and utilizing career services."
Is it more  important  to attend  a prestigious  school  or to attend  a school  that helps   you make money and offers career development potential?,"Most of our students are applying to schools in America and we are strong believers in the idea  that any school we suggest has the opportunity to be a great fit for the student. Students will  choose their school list on a wide range of factors and certainly outcomes (what  happens  after   graduation)  can be one of those  factors.  Schools  will have  dedicated internship offices, career  centers, and alumni offices that all help students receive resources and opportunities for  success. The idea of prestige or money doesnt guarantee anything, especially when the only  thing that really matters is what a student does when they arrive at college. If they take  advantage of every opportunity and have success  in the classroom,  and use their  summers  and  networking  events  wisely,  they  will be in a great position to have success after college, whether  that be in a job or graduate school. But the school list selection process has to really be about  fit and how a students academic profile, activities list, future foals, and personality connect  to the college they are applying to."
Is PSAT  and SAT the same  exam?,"No, its shorter  and generally  easier  than  the offical SAT  since  the PSAT  is testing  more   grade  level  appropriate  test questions  for students at the 9,10th, and 11th grade  levels."
Is publication  guaranteed  for the Academic  Mentorship?,"While  publication  in a specific  selective  academic  journal  can never  be guaranteed,  our  Academic Mentorship program provides students with a range of options to guarantee that  they can present their papers in a suitable place that can be used for their college applications.      Each  student  will receive  individual  advice  on reach,  target  and safety  journals where  they can submit their paper for publication based on their own strategic needs.    Students  can publish  their  papers  in selective  journals,  open -access  platforms,  or  conferences.    Our Teaching  Assistants  and other  instructors  advise  all students  to plan  their  publication submission process very carefully to ensure the best possible outcome!"
Is the interview  virtual  or in person?,Interviews  can be either  virtual  or in person.  This will depend  on the availability  of  alumni  in your area and the particular university you are applying to. InitialView   interviews are typically conducted online.

Is the time  arrangement  for the final  review  reasonable?  Will it affect  my child's  normal   study?,The FAO  will take  2-3 days  to complete  their  review  after  receiving  the materials.  Students should submit their applications via Genie for Final Review at least 10 days  before each application deadline to allow time for FAO review and subsequent  collaboration with the GC on implementation and revisions.
Is there  a big difference  between  practice  SAT scores  and real scores?,"Yes, on the real test,  you are much  more  likely  to be stressed  out, and this is typically   what  leads  to your lower score."

"Is there  flexibility  in the number  of schools?  If my child  wants  to apply  to more  schools  than   the package limit, can we add more?","Yes, there  is flexibility  in the number  of school  applications  our team  will support.  Most   packages  include  a fixed  number  of schools,  e.g. 5, 10 or most  commonly  12 schools.   For an additional cost per school, you may add additional schools to your package  piecemeal.  If  this is of interest  to you,  please  consult  with  your  progress  or case  manager  on adding schools  to your package.    What  are the advantages  of applying  to schools  in multiple  countries?   Depending  on where  you live, grew  up, or have  citizenship,  a certain  country  may   provide an advantage in the admissions process for you. So applying to a few  countries may strategically help you receive more acceptances.    Youll get a wider range of educational opportunities and social experiences  during your college  career.  Different  countries  will approach  college  differently,   so if you are unsure  of the academic or social experience youre looking for or  you could thrive within multiple settings, setting a wide net within different  countries could be very appealing.    Finances  could  play a major  role.  College  is expensive,  but costs  will vary  by country."
"My high  school  follows  ALevel   IGCSE  curriculum,  would  it make  my US applications  less competitive?","No. U.S. admission  committees  are educated  in the assessments  of numerous  academic  pedagogies; therefore, they will be able to put all academic grades into the proper  context."
"My high  school  follows  APIB  curriculum,  would  it make  my UK application  less  competitive?","The answer  is the same  as for 9. UK schools  accept  courses  taken  in both  the AP and IB  programs. However, they may have specific requirements for which AP courses they  would like to see their applicants to have already taken."

Should  I ask the interviewer  questions  during  the interview?,"Yes!  You absolutely  want  to come  prepared  to ask the interviewer  questions.  These   should  not be questions that can be easily answered by visiting the schools website (for example, if a school offers a particular major). Rather, you want to ask about intangible  experiences if your interviewer had one piece of advice to offer every incoming first  year, what would it be? Or perhaps you want to ask the interviewer about something  that surprised them the most about the school. You can also ask about the interviewers  perception of the particular program or department to which youre applying, but they  may or may not have a response depending on what they studied."
"Should  I attend  a summer  program,  do an internship,  or do online  research  in summer?","When it comes to designing an impactful summer plan, theres no one -size-fits-all answer   each  students  goals  and interests  matter  most.  Summer  programs,  internships,  and research  all  offer valuable experiences, and ideally, your selections should reflect your academic focus and  personal passions. We recommend prioritizing depth over prestige choose the opportunity  that allows for genuine growth and impact. Often, a combination of activities provides for a  dynamic summer,  and we encourage  students  to take  advantage  of opportunities  they  might   not normally be able to during the school year.

Should  I select  schools  based  on their  major  ranking  or overall  ranking?,"Ingenius  Prep advocates for a balanced and informed approach    Major rankings are more relevant for students with a specific career path in mind.    Overall rankings provide a general indication of the university's quality and  reputation.    The best  strategy  is to consider  both,  along  with  the student's  academic   interests,  career aspirations, and personal preferences."

Should  I take  4 HL and 2 SL?,"This question is best answered by a students academic advisor. The advisor will know  the students  academic  strengths  and weaknesses  better  than  an IGP counselor  and the  school advisor will also know how students at that school do with four HL courses and  two SL courses. Also, speaking with an advisor will also make certain that the classes a  student takes will meet the overall requirements for the diploma.

Should  I take  AP for the subjects  if I do not take  the course  at school?,"Usually if an AP is not offered in your school, your time would be better spent on things  that will move  the needle  more  on your  college  applications.  There  are so many  students  taking APs that they are not as much of a differentiator. You might also be better off  doing actual college courses for credit instead, since those would be more positively  viewed than APs. While APs can give college credit, they generally arent viewed as  positively as actual college courses. This would also allow you to take a course in  something more niche and specialized, which would catch an AOs attention and could   be more related to the interests reflected in the rest of your application.

Should  my child  consider  some  other  programs  in case  xx program  is too competitive?,"Yes, Ingenius  Prep  strongly  advises  having  alternative  plans  and a balanced   college  list. Exploring related majors or programs can increase the chances of  admission and provide alternative pathways to achieve career goals. The IGP  team will discuss closely with the student and family  and advise  in accordance  with  how  aggressive  studentsfamilies  want  to  pursue  selective universities."
Should I determine my academic interests first and then engage in related activities?,"Yes, though  doing  activities  is one way to help  explore  your  interests.  So, your  counselors   will often advise you to explore your interests and try some related activities at the  same time."
Should I include activities that don't directly relate to my intended major?,"Yes! Many students include activities that are not directly related to their major. Admissions  officers want to know how a student might contribute to their campus in ways  outside  of the  classroom.  So, if you participate  in activities  including  sports,  art, music, etc. that are not  related to your major, you should still include these items on your AL."
Should I include family obligation or caregiving experiences in my AL?,"Yes!  If you spend  a significant  amount  of time  (eg, at least  an hour  a week  on average) caring for  a relative or helping out your family, this can be included on the Activity List. However, if your  AL is already full of other activities, you might consider adding a note about significant family  obligations in the Additional Information section."

What  are EAEDREA?,"Early Decision vs. Early Action vs. Restricted Early Action  it can all seem confusing.  Here  are  some  helpful  things  to keep  in mind  when  deciding  whats  right  for you or your  child    Early  Decision  (ED)  ED is a binding  commitment  where  a student   commits  to attending the college if accepted. Typically the application  deadline for ED is in  early November; and students can expect to  receive decision notifications in  early December. Students can only  apply ED to one college.    Early  Action  (EA)  EA is non-binding,  meaning  that students  are not  required  to attend if accepted. Similar to ED, EA deadlines are typically  in early November;  and students can expect to receive decision  notifications in early December.  Students can apply EA to multiple  colleges.    Restricted  Early  Action  (REA)  Like EA, REA is non-binding  and deadlines   are typically in early November with decision notifications occurring in  early  December. Students can only apply REA to one college and may be  limited in  applying to other early programs. Each college offering REA  has its own set of  restrictions, so students must read these policies  carefully."

What  are standard  program  dates  and durations?,"Programs  can range  from  one week  to eight  weeks,  with  most  lasting  around  two to four  weeks  in the summer.  Dates  are typically  listed  on each  programs  website.  We recommend  building  a  summer schedule early to avoid overlaps, though you will likely end up applying to multiple  programs and comparing your options once decisions come in!"
What  are the common  reasons  for deferral?,"Space - Enrollment is always going to be limited and there just isnt enough space  to admit   every  ED or EA applicant.  There  will always  be more  qualified applicants than admission  spots available.    AOs want to see more information - Typically, they want to see a complete  semester or term of grades from 12th grade. Sometimes theyll offer you the  ability  to complete  a form  or send  in a letter,  so updating  them  on recent   activities can also be helpful too.    Being  nice - There  are some  schools  that do not deny  students  from  their  ED or  EA rounds, so they defer everyone else."

"What  can I highlight  in my letter?""","The specifics of what you highlight will vary depending on your particular background,  interests,  and goals  (a potential  math  major  will want  to highlight  different  qualities  and  stories than a potential cinema studies major, for example). That said, there are some  general  principles  that apply  no matter  what  your  academic  interests  or eventual  goals  are    1 Have your teachers provide concrete examples to back up the qualities of  yours they discuss. Having a specific story demonstrating the trait of yours the  teacher  wants  to highlight  goes  a long  way in convincing  the admissions  officer!     2 Emphasize  personal  qualities  of yours,  including  but not limited  to (choose  3-5  to highlight)   o Academic  Success   o Intellectual  Ability   o Written  Expression   o Creative Qualities   o Academic  Involvement   o Character  and Personality  Traits   o Respect  for Others   o Initiative   o LeadershipInfluence   o Self-Confidence   o Self-Discipline   o Character  and Integrity   o Potential  for Growth   3 Have  your  teachers  discuss  your  in-class  behavior  and attitude.  Even  if the  recommender  is also a club advisor  or knows  you outside  of the classroom,  it is  imperative  that admissions  counselors  get a sense  of who  you are in the classroom.

What  does  the College  Bootcamp  include?  How  does  it help  students  prepare  for college  applications?,"Not sure what this is, not part of LIL."
"What  does  the waitlist  admission  strategy  include?  Such  as school  selection  advice,  essay revision, interview coaching, etc.?","From the Admissions side of the process, they know that they cannot admit everyone that is  qualified or that makes an impact on the Admissions team. They are  also running  a lot of data   (called  yield  modeling)  to try and predict  the number of students that are going to accept their  spots once they have been admitted to the class. Sometimes, after May 1st, when students  have to decide to enroll, a college will have extra spots available. They will then turn to the  Waitlist and choose a number of students they now want to officially admit into the class.    When  we work  with  students  at InGenius  who  have  been  Waitlisted,  the first  step is to review the acceptance offers that have been received, and compare  that to the Waitlist opportunity. For some students, they have already been  admitted to schools that are more exciting than the WL, so there would be no  reason to say yes to the WL if the student doesnt have an interest in that  school any longer.    For students that receive a WL offer and believe they would rather enroll at that  school, instead of the acceptances they currently have, they will say yes to that  offer. There really isnt much strategy from the student perspective as the school  will explain to them the steps of the WL (deadline to say yesno and whether a  form  or a letter  of continued  interest  is acceptable).  Once  they  say yes and turn   in the formletter, all they can do is wait.    Students cannot, and should not, attempt to rewrite essays or change anything  about their application. There also isnt an opportunity to interview or talk to  the admissions  office  either.  They  simply  need  to know  your  intentions  about   staying on the WL and then the formletter that they may ask for; thats it!"
What  if I do not find an Academic  Mentorship  topic  that interests  me?,"InGenius  provides  students  with  a wide  range  of topics  through  our Group  AM offerings, but  many more topic options are available!      Our Academic  Mentorship  team  and counselors  work  with  aspiring  student  researchers to help them find a topic thats right for them.

What  if I do not take  the AP in Grade  12 even  though  I said I would?,"As long  as you meet  the expected  grades  consistent  with  what  is expected  in your   application,  this should not be a problem."
What  if I don't  know  any teacher  that might  be willing  to write  a letter  for me?,"It is important to build relationships with your teachers throughout high school. If  youre not  yet in your  senior  year,  start  building  those  relationships  now.  Ask questions   in class, visit the teacher at lunch to talk about any connections youre making with  other classes or topics within the class that you found particularly interesting, and make  sure youre putting your full effort towards the work for the course.  If youre  currently  in your  senior  year  and do not have  these  relationships  established  already, there may still be time! Use the beginning of your senior year to make a  determined effort to build a relationship with your teachers.     If you do not have the time to build these relationships, the best teachers to ask would  be those for classes in which youve participated the most, and in which youve got the  best grades. You may be surprised at how closely your teachers have been paying  attention!  Though  you may  not feel as though  you have  a relationship  with  any  particular teacher, they may have noticed efforts youve been making in class or  qualities youve demonstrated that allowed you to earn a strong grade."
What  if I dont  seem  to have  any interest  in any subject?,"Things that you do for fun can be related to academic interests as well  for example, video  game  development  is a popular  major!  Think  about  the things  you do for fun even  if they  dont  seem  academic  to you and talk to your  counselors  about  how  these  activities  potentially  relate  to different majors."
What  if I lose interest  next  year  in what  Im passionate  about  today?,"That can happen! Its not a problem  were working on developing an application persona  around  what  youve  done  in high  school.  While  this is a good  snapshot  for admissions  officers  of  what youre likely to do in college, they also understand that many students change their  minddevelop  new  interests.  We would  likely  still advise  you to continue  building  your  profile  in  this area, but to potentially explore other possible majors in college, once youre accepted  at  most schools, you dont declare your major until the end of freshman yearsophomore year."
What  if I miss  a class?  Will I be able  to catch  up on the missed  material?,"All excused absences require 24 hours' advance notice. Anyone with an excused  absence  can receive  a recording  of the class  missed.  However,  its important  to note  that  this course is highly participatory and does not translate well asynchronously. Regular  attendance is required."

What  if my child  does  not get into any summer  programs?,"Thats okay! There are still many ways to build a meaningful summer, including independent  research, volunteering, creative projects, or local internships. Well help create a strong backup  plan and highlight initiative on your childs resume. Often, students will use time over the  summer to initiate a Signature Project .

What  if my G12 AP scores  are very  bad?,"As long  as you meet  the expected  grades consistent  with  what  is expected  in your   application,  this should  not be a problem."
"What  if my grades  are not really  good,  which  teacher  should  I ask to write  the letter?","If your grades are generally low, the best teachers to ask for a letter of recommendation  would be the teachers you have the best relationship with and who have helped you the  most. Though these teachers wont necessarily be able to speak to your particular  aptitude in a subject, they will be able to speak to more intangible qualities that are  necessary for students to have. These can be qualities like perseverance and fortitude -  though  you might  not have  the best  grades,  did you give up? Are you the type  of student  whose strengths lie outside of the academics themselves? If so, seek teachers who can  speak to those strengths. Teachers who double as club advisors may be particularly  good for this approach!"
"What  if my school  doesn't  offer  AP, can I still take  the test?","Yes, but usually  if an AP is not offered in your school, your time would be better spent  on things that will move the needle more on your college applications. Your academics  are evaluated by AOs based on the actual courses offered by your school."
What  if the academic  subjects  that  I am interested  in pursuing  are not offered   by the college?,"Ingenius  Prep  offers  the following  guidance    Consider  exploring  related  majors  or interdisciplinary  programs  that may  align  with  your   interests.

What  is the difference  between  the Scholarly  Review  Journal  and the Legacy  Gazette?,"The Scholarly  Review  Journal  is a peer -reviewed  academic  journal.    an open -access  journal  dedicated  to publishing  academic  research  by high  school  students  in  the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities.  The SR Journal editorial board is made of highly accomplished professors and academics in  corresponding fields. Submissions go through a thorough process of review, and all student  submissions to the journal are scrutinized by members of the editorial team. Board members  make  the final  selection,  after  authors  have  responded  to matters  arising  during  the process  of  review,  and after  checks  have  been  made  for plagiarism  and accuracy  of content.  If a member  of the editorial team has a conflict of interest, for example, arising from having taught the  student or contributed ideas or materials for the paper, she will take no part in the review  process.     All high  school  students  are welcome  to submit  their  work  regardless  of educational  or personal  background. Our intention is to provide any student authors with the opportunity to go  through the submission, feedback, and potential publication or showcasing process. True to  this goal, the Scholarly Review Journal does not charge student authors any fee to maximize  access for all.    The Legacy  Gazette  is not peer -reviewed  and not an academic  journal.     The Legacy Gazette is a platform for students to feature their work and an extracurricular  activity for students interested in gaining some editorial experience and enhancing their  profile! A  new  issue  of the Gazette  will be released  every  2 months  on the first day of the  month.  Issues will alternate between focusing on the arts and the humanities and the natural  sciences and STEM.     A team  of motivated  students  are invited  to join the Legacy  Gazette's  editorial  team,  working  under the supervision of the Editor -in-Chief."

What  is the main  difference  between  the Intensive  1v1 Program  and the  Extensive 1v1 Program?,The Intensive and Extended programs have the same goals and same content structure. The  Extended program is simply lengthier than the Intensive one - designed for  students  who  enjoy   a slower  working  pace  and more  guidance  and mentorship  along the process. The Intensive  program also considers the fact that some students may be closer to their application season  and therefore would like to proceed at a more speedy pace.

We help assess fit based on your childs transcript, study habits, and goals.  Some programs are more intensive and designed for advanced students, while others offer  more  flexibility.  We aim to challenge  but not overwhelm.  We recommend  all students  apply   to Reach,  Target,  and Safety  options,  both  for summer  and for college  applications   themselves."
"What  is the school  selection  process  like?  What  steps  are involved,  and how  will we be involved?","School research is the backbone of a student making good choices about their school  list. We  provide an Orientation workshop about this in early Spring and then our counseling team takes  the completed homework for their students to have more in depth conversation  about  what   they  are looking  for in their  schools.  We are trying  to learn  about the likesdislikes that a  student has that can allow us to recommend a list of schools to research. It then becomes an  exercise of collaboration where we learn from the student and suggest more schools. This is  repeated again and again until we reach the number  of schools a student has in their AC  package.   Size,  location,  major  are very  easy  filters  to begin  using.  From  there,  we delve   into more complex characteristics like community, personality, academicsocial  experiences, and fit. We also consider acceptance rates, the students  academic profile and ECs, to determine  their  relative  chances  of being  admitted   and adjust  the school  list accordingly.    Families  are involved  the entire  time.  There  arent  any secrets  or information   that we are hiding.  The student  is always  going  to be the driving  factor  in the  advicestrategy  that we give, but we know the family has a major investment in  this process, so hearing constructive feedback at the appropriate time is great."
What  is the size of the LIL Venture  Fund?  How  can I apply  for it?,"Students  can apply  for funding  from  the LIL Venture  Fund  in 2 funding  cycles,  April  and November .  All projects  are evaluated  individually  and holistically,  in the exact  same  way - projects  from  LIL students  do not receive  any favorable  treatment  in the evaluation process.  Student  need  not be a student  of a LIL program  to apply  for funding;  however,  given  that LIL   programs  help  students  to concretely  build  robust  projectsorganizations  with  clear actions  and  expansion  plans,  generally  LIL students  tend  to present  more  competitive projectsorganizations   and this is reflected  in their  success  rate in applying  for funding, even  though  I reiterate  that all  applications  are subject  to the same  evaluation  criteria.     There  is no fixed  number  of students  who  can get funding.  It depends  on how  many studentsprojects   applied  that funding  cycle.  This means  if very  few projects  applied  for funding  in a specific  funding   cycle,  it is likely  that each  studentproject  will receive  more funding.  We have  more  than  5000  USD   each  funding  cycle  to give out.    Our goal  is to try to help  as many  studentsprojects  that merit  it as possible.  So we try our very   best  to stretch  our budget  to help  as many  as possible.  Bearing  in mind  as well that each  funding   cycle  is 6 months,  meaning  while  we may  not be able  to fund  each studentproject  to the full  amount  requested,  we invite  all studentsprojects  to come  back again  in the next  funding  cycle  to  apply  for funding  again.  As long  as it is merited,  there  is no  upper  limit  as to how  many  times  a  studentproject  can apply  for funding  and be awarded.     More  information  about  the LVF and awardees  can be found  here ."
What  is the success  rate of waitlist  admission?,"WL admission  rates  will vary  wildly  based  on the school.

What  is the value  of attending  a summer  program?,"A summer program offers students the opportunity to delve deeper into a specific  academic  interest  and gain  insight  into further  engagement  with  the subject.  Students may also refine their skills in collaboration, critical thinking, public speaking, writing,  andor research.     Additionally,  an in-person  summer  program  at a university  offers  students  a look  into the  college student experience on a real campus, since they often reside in dorms, eat in  dining halls, and attend class in college classrooms. Courses are also often taught by  scholars and professors, giving students a sense for learning at the college level."
"What  kind  of feedback  will I receive  on my writing,  and how  often?",Feedback  will be given  on weekly  assignments  turned  in on time  and through  one-to-one  conferences between the student and instructor.

What  kind  of projects  will I be working  on in this program?  Can I choose  my  project direction?,"You can work on any project you want. We always say - any domain, any type, any scale. The  only determinant is your own comfort level, time, energy and resources - motivation too of  course! Most students decide to work on projects that are related to their intended major  directions and that combine their academic andor non -academic interests  and hobbies  so that  their  project  becomes  an all-rounded  embodiment  of their whole person."

The ACT is also moving  towards  a digital  format , with  a digital  ACT launching  in April  20251  ....  This change is partly to compete with the SAT's shorter length and potentially increased  attractiveness2 . Previously, both tests were primarily administered in a paper -based format.     Length of the Exam     The digital SAT is significantly shorter , now being 33 shorter, or a full hour less , than its  previous  paper -based  version2  . This shorter  duration  is seen  as a major  benefit,  making  the SAT  a more appealing test to study for2 .     The ACT is changing  its length  in April  2025 , likely  to become  shorter  to be more  competitive   with the SAT2 .  The exact new duration of the ACT is not specified in the provided sources.     Structure of Sections     The SAT has blended its Reading and Writing sections into a single Reading and Writing  section2 .  Test -takers now receive a single score for this combined section, unlike the previous  format  with  separate  Reading  and Writing  scores2  . This section  comprises  two 32-minute   modules5  .    The ACT maintains separate sections for English (which includes grammar and rhetoric),  Reading,  and Science,  in addition  to Mathematics6  . The Science  section  of the ACT is noted   as being heavily reliant on reading comprehension skills6 ."

What extracurricular activity is helpful to enhance my profile?,"Extracurricular activities in which the student has a leadership role and can make a  demonstrated impact on their community, such as through service or fundraising, are most   valuable.  Starting  a club,  non-profit  organization,  business,  or leading  some  other unique event  (such as an art show or research conference) is also a terrific way to enhance your profile."
What if I don't have enough activities for the AL?,"You should  fill as many  spaces  as possible  by considering  the wide  range  of ways  that you  spent   your  time  outside  of class.  Consider  including  any family  responsibilities  that take up significant  time (such as taking care of younger siblings or a grandparent) or forms of structured  independent learning (teaching yourself Python), research, or creative projects (eg, writing a  novel).     If you have  time  available,  search  for short -term  community  service  activities  that fit with your  application persona to fill additional slots of the Activity List."
"What if I scored 3 in AP Lang (XX course), shall I cancel the score?","If the AP course is showing up on your high school transcript as an AP, then an AO is  likely to suspect that you  got a 1 or 2, so submitting  3s is recommended.  If the course   does  not show  up as an AP on the transcript, then you are fine to cancel without any  negative consequences.   17) Shall  I take  AP Capstone   AP Seminar?"

Students can ask for an extension for their final paper, but"
What SAT score is needed for the top 103050 schools?,1500 is best in most cases. The  easiest  rule of thumb  is to look  at the schools  75th   and 25th  percentile  scores  and try to be between those to scores or above the 75th  percentile to be even more competitive as an applicant.
What should I include in the activity description?,"Use short  phrases  with  action  verbs  to describe  your  most  significant  duties  in a role; your  accomplishments (using quantifiable measures when possible, such as money raised); andor  what you learned."

What's  a proper  process  to translate  a letter?,"If your  recommender  is not comfortable  writing  your  letter  of recommendation  in  English, ask them to write the letter in their native language. Guide the recommender  (or bring the  letter  yourself)  to certified  translation  services  (your  InGenius  team  can  help  you find local  services,  if necessary).  Then,  have  your  recommender  upload  both   the original  and translated versions of the recommendation letter to the online application system."
What's  liberal  arts school?  What's  the difference  and similarity  compared  to  national schools?,"Ingenius  Prep  defines  liberal  arts colleges  as institutions  that emphasize  a broad -based   education  in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences.       a. Differences  Liberal  arts colleges  are typically  smaller,  focus  primarily  on  undergraduate  education, and prioritize close student -faculty interaction.   b. Similarities  Both  liberal  arts colleges  and national  universities  offer  a wide   range  of academic programs and value a strong academic foundation.       Most  of the notable  liberal  arts colleges  are located  in suburban  or rural  areas,  so if  a student  strongly desires an urban setting then it is likely that liberal arts colleges  may not be the best fit."
What's  the benefit  of attending  the summer  school  at UChicago?,"If a student  attends  summer  school  at the University  of Chicago,  then  they  will  be welcome  to submit  an early  application  for undergraduate  admission  due in  early October of Grade 12."
"What's  the cost  for adding  more  schools?  If I want  to apply  to more  schools  than   the package includes, how much does each additional school cost?","To inquire about the cost of adding more schools to your application list beyond what is  included in a standard package,  please  reach  out to Ingenius  Prep  directly.  They  can provide  you  with  the most  accurate  and current  pricing information."
What's  the difference  between  public  and private  school?,"Ingenius Prep distinguishes between public and private universities based on funding and  governance       Public  universities are  funded by  state governments  and tend  to be  larger, with  a focus  on  serving  state residents.       Private  universities  rely on endowments  and tuition,  often  have  smaller  student  bodies,   and may  have  a specific religious or philosophical orientation.   As a general rule of thumb, it is easier to switch majors in a private university than a public one."
Whats  the difference  between  short -term  and long -term  projects?  Which  one is more  suitable for me?,"The main difference is the students willingness to continue the project. From the perspective  of college admissions, your project would need to at least until your own application season is  over. Hypothetically, if you begin your project now, lets say in April,  it would  need  to last at  least  until  January  of the following  year,  to complete  your application season.     In general, the longer a projectenterprise has been ongoing, the more value it will add to your  application, particularly to the highly competitive elite universities. Hence the question of  should I do a short term or long term project is somewhat of a misunderstanding. The correct  focus should be - what kind of project can I do that will best  integrate  and bring  together  more   disparate  elements  in my profile  at the moment, that I will be able to and be interested in  carrying on regularly over a longer period of time, without feeling that it will constitute too  much of a burden."
"What's  the difference  between  third  party  interview  and admission  interview,  or alumni   interview?","Third party interviews are conducted by an organization, such as InitialView, not  affiliated with a specific  university.  Alumni  interviews  are conducted  by a graduate  of the  university  with  which  you are interviewing. Interviewing with a third party such as  InitialView can be a great option for students with limited availability, or who do not  have access to alumni interviews at a particular school  for any reason  (such  as an  alumnus  not being  available  in the students  area).  Interviewing directly with a university  through something like an alumni interview is a strong option when available as  admissions counselors will be familiar with their interviewers, who will have been  trained to ask questions specifically catered to that particular university."
"What's  the difficulty  of applying  to YYGS,  SHI, etc.?","Very popular programs Yale Young Global Scholars , Ross Mathematics , Iowa Young   Writers Studio , Secondary Student Training Program , for example are very competitive  because of the high volume of top applicants. Additionally, some programs are highly  selective because they only admit a small number of top -notch applicants or offer the  course free -of-charge. This includes the Research Science Institute , Notre Dame   Leadership Seminars , Telluride Association Summer Program , and Stanford Summer   Humanities  Institute . Many  of these  programs  also often  reserve  space  for older   students (e.g., rising Grade 12), so younger students are inherently at a disadvantage."

"What's  the recommended  ratio  of reach,  match,  and safety  schools?","A balanced  school  list will have  a healthy  mix of reach,  target  and safety  schools.    Typically  this means  roughly  (though  this is ultimately  student -specific)    20  safety  schools    30  target  schools    50  reach  schools"
Whats  the schedule  of the program?  Will it interfere  with  my child's academic  workload?,"As long  as students  prepare  well and follow  our advice,  participating  in a research program  should enhance rather than detract from a students overall academic workload.      We advise  our students  to carefully  consider  their  availability  to make  the most  of their  research opportunity.    Students  should  commit  at least  4 hours  per week  to their  Academic  Mentorship to  maximize their chance of success.    Students  will usually  meet  with  their  mentors  and TAs on a weekly  basis  but they should  dedicate several hours per week to their independent work outside the meetings to  make the most of the meetings.    We offer  a tailored  experience  and are always  open  to discussing  ways  to help  students succeed on the program."
What's  the TOEFL  requirement  to apply  to any given  summer  school?,"TOEFL, an English proficiency exam, has requirements that vary by program, so please check  the official  website  of the program  youre  interested  in (your  counseling  team  can help  to  verify). Many competitive programs expect scores of 90, and some may offer waivers  depending on your school background. Again, were happy to help review specific programs  with you. For admission to undergraduate programs at top US colleges, TOEFL scores of 105  are often required. Read more about the basics of the TOEFL  on InGeniuss blog."

"When  are program  deadlines,  and what  are their  requirements?","Deadlines vary but often fall between January and March (and as early as October). Most  programs require a transcript, personal statement (or multiple essays), and sometimes  recommendation  letters  or TOEFL  scores.  We can help  ensure  everything  is submitted  correctly.  Read through the application requirements multiple times!"
When  do programs  open  for applications?,Many  open  between  October  and January.  We suggest  setting  reminders  for your  top-choice  programs and beginning application prep early to stay ahead of deadlines.
When  does  the final  review  usually  start?  How  long  does  it last?  When  do I need  to  submit  my application materials?,"The final review process typically starts when the GC, FAO, and student agree that all  application  materials  are essentially  complete  and in good  shape.  Students  should  aim  to submit  their  applications  for Final  Review  at least  10 days  before  the official   deadline.  The FAO will then complete the review within 2 -3 days."
When  does  waitlist  support  start?  How  long  does  it last?,"Waitlist decisions typically come when Regular Decision results are released,  anywhere  from  February  to late March.  Each  school  will have  their  own   policies, so sometimes a WL decision may come from an ED or EA application,  but the vast majority will come from RD.    We work with students on their WL formsletters in March and April. Once the  formsletters are submitted, we can only wait for schools to update their  applicants. If a student is offered a spot from the WL, we are present to provide  advicestrategy. Because a WL offer is not binding, a student is able to compare  their  current  enrollment  choice  to the new  WL offer  and make  a decision.  We  are able to  help with that. WL activity usually stops in early summer, so well  help as long as necessary."
"When  is the best  time  to attend  a summer  program,  earlier  or later?",Attend  a summer  program  whenever  it is most  convenient.  The timing  doesnt  matter  to  anyone save  the student and their family.
When  is the right  time  to participate  in an Academic  Mentorship?,"InGenius  offers  individualized  Academic  Mentorship  opportunities  for students  of all ages  G7.      G7-G9 students  can complete  a Junior  Academic  Mentorship  in which  they  learn  fundamental research skills and write a research proposal.    G7-G11 students  can complete  a Research  Interest  Exploration  Program  (RIEP), gaining a  taste of 7 different subjects and writing a research proposal to help them narrow their  interests.    G9-12 students  can complete  a senior  Group  Academic  Mentorship  and write  an  individual research paper.    G9-12 students  can complete  a senior  1v1 Academic  Mentorship  with  TA Support and  write an individual research paper.    Grad  students  can complete  a 1v1 Academic  Mentorship  and write  an individual  research paper.    All students  have  to choose  different  research  outcomes  in addition  to, or instead of, a  research paper, such as a technical output, portfolio piece, data visualization,  conference presentation or other capstone project."
When  should  I start  exploring  my interests?,"Its never  too early,  but generally,  this should  start  around  the beginning  of high  school,  or  whenever a new student starts with InGenius."
When  should  I start  preparing  for the SAT or the ACT?,"Based on the information in the sources and our conversation history, the optimal time to  begin preparing  for the SAT or the ACT depends  on several  factors , including  your  current   grade  level, your proficiency in the relevant subject matter (especially mathematics), and  your desired score improvement1  Here's a detailed breakdown of when you should  consider starting your   preparation     Consider  Your  Math  Curriculum     For the SAT, it is generally  recommended  to wait  until  you have  completed  the Algebra  2  curriculum and are possibly starting pre -calculus2  ... The SAT covers  material  up to Algebra  2 with   a slight touch of pre-calculus, so having a solid foundation in these areas is crucial before  intensive preparation2  . Students  taking  pre-calculus  are in a particularly  good  position  as they   review  Algebra 2 concepts, which are heavily tested on the SAT2 .     For the ACT, which  tests  concepts  through  some  more  advanced  aspects  of pre-calculus,  you might  consider waiting a little longer, perhaps until you have more exposure to these advanced topics2 .     Reading  and Writing  Skills  Development     Reading and writing skills take a long time to develop2 . Therefore, you can potentially start  familiarizing  yourself  with  the test format  and strategies  for these  sections  earlier , even  if you  haven't fully delved into math preparation2 . Learning techniques to leverage your existing  reading and writing abilities can be beneficial early on2 .    Reading  and Writing  scores  can be harder  to move  significantly , so starting  the process  of  understanding the test and practicing strategies earlier might be advantageous4 .     General Recommendations by Grade Level     Starting preparation in either the 10th or 11th grade is generally a good timeframe for most  students 4 . By this point,  you have  typically  progressed  through  the necessary  math  curriculum,   and you allow yourself sufficient time to take the test multiple times and work towards your  target score without  feeling  rushed,  especially  when  also managing  college  applications  and  other  commitments4   .   For students  in the 10th  grade , you still have  ample  time.  If you have  progressed  well in your   math curriculum (beyond Algebra 2), you could potentially consider taking the test earlier.  Otherwise, focusing on your coursework and then starting more intensive prep after  completing Algebra 2 is advisable3 .     For students  in the 11th  grade , it's a good  time  to seriously  start  preparing.  Aiming  for test  dates  like March, August, or October can be strategic as they often provide sufficient study  time without conflicting heavily with demanding periods of the school year like final projects  and end -of-semester work4 ....     Preparation Timeline     While  some  might  consider  last-minute  cramming,  it is generally  not recommended  and can be  stressful6 .     For substantial  score  improvements , a preparation  period  of 8 to 12 weeks  is often  ideal 6 .  This allows for a more relaxed schedule, the possibility of addressing any learning obstacles,  and sufficient time for focused study leading up to the test6 .  A minimum of four weeks of  dedicated preparation is suggested, and that is typically for students who are already scoring at  a high level6 .     Consider the timing of the test dates in relation to your academic workload and other  commitments.  Test  dates  in November  and December  can be challenging  for students  with   rigorous course loads due to conflicts with final projects and grading periods5  The newly  released   September  SAT option , coupled  with  the August  test,  presents  a good  opportunity  for focused  summer preparation with two test administrations in close succession4 ....     Diagnostic Testing     Regardless of when you plan to start, it's beneficial to begin with a baseline diagnostic test for  both the SAT and the ACT 7 ..... This helps  you identify  your  strengths  and weaknesses  on each   test  format  and determine  which  test might  be a better  fit for you,  influencing  where  you should   focus your preparation efforts and time8 ....   In summary, while there's no one -size-fits-all answer, a good rule of thumb is to start preparing  in the  10th  or 11th  grade  after  you have  a solid  foundation  in Algebra  2 (for the SAT) , allowing   for at least 8 -12 weeks of focused study before your chosen test date. Starting earlier with  familiarizing yourself with the reading and writing sections and taking diagnostic tests for both  the SAT and ACT can also be helpful in planning your preparation strategy2 ...."
When  will the interview  normally  take  place?,"Interviews  generally  take  place  in the weeks  directly  after  submitting  your  application,   though  this may vary depending on the specific school and their policies."
When do I need to start working on my AL?,You should  begin  drafting  your  Activity  List early  in your  high  school  years  (as soon  as 9th grade)  and continue to update it throughout as a kind of Master Resume.
When do my SAT or ACT scores expire?,"They dont technically expire. Its just that schools may have a preference for more  recent scores. But for the average high schooler,  you dont  have  anything  to worry   about;  taking  the exam  as early  as freshman year  is fine,  those  scores  will still be  acceptable  to colleges.  What  college  is really  going to turn you away because you  scored a 1500 SAT or 34 ACT score as a freshman?"
When should I finalize my AL?,"You should  plan  to have  a full draft  by the end of 11th  grade,  with  plans  to make  final updates by  the start of your senior year."
Where  will the student  publish  their  paper  from  the Academic Mentorship?,"InGenius  Academic  Mentorship  program  provides  students  with  a wide  range  of potential  publication options.      Each  student  will receive  individual  advice  on reach,  target  and safety  journals where  they can submit their paper for publication based on their own strategic needs.    Students  can publish  their  papers  in selective  journals,  open -access  platforms,  or  conferences.    Our Teaching  Assistants  and other  instructors  advise  all students  to plan  their  publication submission process very carefully to ensure the best possible outcome!"
Which  materials  are required  for applying  to summer  programs?,"Typically,  summer  programs  require  some  combination  of the following    Application  form    Personal  essays    Transcript    One or two recommendation  letters   Test  scores  (TOEFL,  and SATACT  if available)    Additional  writing  samples  (Iowa  Young  Writers  requires  an abbreviated   portfolio) Check each programs site for specifics  well help you stay organized."
Which  program  at UPenns  Wharton  is the best?,"Wharton offers several strong pre -college options, including Leadership in the Business World   (LBW) , Essentials  of Finance , and Data  Science  Academy . LBW  tends  to be the most  selective  and well -known, but the best fit depends on your interests and academic strengths. Well help  you choose strategically."
Which  programs  have  the earliest  deadlines?,Programs  like Stanford  Summer  Session  and RISE  at Boston  University  tend  to open  and close  early  sometimes  as soon  as November  or December.  Yale Young  Global  Scholars  (YYGS)  is  also due in October.  Its best  to start  looking  in the fall and track  deadlines  in a shared  calendar  or document. Our blog  has advice to assist you in planning effectively!
Which  subject  teachers  should  choose  to write  the letter  for me?,"Its a good idea to get one letter from a class in which you write essays (English, history,  etc) and one from a class in which you complete problem sets (biology, math, etc). This  will demonstrate your ability and engagement across academic disciplines. If you have  two particularly strong relationships with teachers in similar disciplines, speak to your  counseling team to determine if its best for you to demonstrate capability across  disciplines,  or to lean  on your  strong  relationships  with  teachers  within  similar   disciplines."
Which  summer  programs  should  I apply  to?,"Summer program options often depend on a students age or grade level. For example,  SummerBrown  and Columbia Summer Immersion  are two popular programs among  Grade 9 students; while Yale Young Global Scholars , Summer Science Program , and  Whartons Leadership in the Business World  are reserved for upperclassmen. Keep an  eye out for selective  summer  programs  hosted  by top universities  with  the opportunity   to learn from scholars."
"Which  universities  are test-blind,  test-flexible,  test-optional,  and test-required?","The UCs are test blind,  but as stated  before,  its best  to check  on this at the time  of  application here is a helpful resource   httpswww.collegedata.comresourcesprepare -and-applytest -optional -test-blind - whats - the-difference"
Which APIB courses are the most rigorous and how should I prepare for them?,"There is no absolute answer for whether or not  one course is more rigorous than  another.  Some  kids are strong  in math,  for both  AP Calculus  courses  might  be easy  and  just a pathway to multivariable calculus or linear algebra.   Just the same,  following  up on my answer  to question  1, if an applicant  plans  to pursue  a tech  or STEM  major,  AP courses  in math  and science  will seem  to be the most  rigorous  because usually they are the highest level of courses offered at certain high schools.   Keep in mind that not all high schools offer AP courses because those schools are not  satisfied with the way those courses are taught. So, it is important for families to  understand  this and must  identify  which  courses  match  up with  AP courses.  They  can ask  the applicants academic advisor or IGP counselor.   To prepare  for rigorous  courses,  schools  will offer  a progression  of classes  that will give their students a foundation for those rigorous classes.  Classes  in an IB program  are separated  into high  level  or standard  level  courses.  The high  level, or HL, classes are the most rigorous."
Which colleges require SAT scores to be submitted?,This changes every year; its best to  check  the admissions  requirements  for all the  colleges  you are applying  to individually.
Which extracurricular activity can help with leadership?,"Just about any activity in which the student can make an impact on their school or community  can help the student demonstrate leadership and impact. In addition to being  the leader  of a  school  club,  students  should  consider  running  for student  council or student government roles  in their school. Students should also explore leadership opportunities beyond their school. See  the Community Involvement and Leadership  Cheat Sheet  for ideas."

"Who  has the final  say in deciding  the school  list? Is it me, the counselor,  or a joint  decision?","Who  has the final  say in deciding  the school  list? Is it me, the counselor,  or a joint  decision?"
"Who  has the final  say in school  selection?  Is it the parents,  the child,  or the counselor?",The family. We hope that its a collaborative process and the studentsparents take our advice   into strong  consideration  as they  are making  their  decisions.  We only  want  to help and give  advice that provides the student with the most positive outcomes when the process is over.
Why  is an FAO  helpful?,"   An Former  Admissions  Officer  (FAO)  is helpful  for many  reasons!    They  were  involved  in making  decisions  for who  got in, and who  didnt,  at a selective  college. From these experiences they have a deep understanding of what it takes to  stand out in the college admissions process.    They  will provide  your  with  strategic  advice  on academic  preparation  like what  classes  to  take  at school,  when  to take  standardized  tests,  and how  to demonstrate  your  strengths  through outside of school academic programs like summer programs and competitions.    They  will help  guide  your  interest  exploration,  which  is a key piece  of your  Candidacy  Building.    They will help you with your extracurricular enhancement by helping you design  signature  projects,  research  projects,  and other  activities  to support  your  Application  Persona"
Why  is interest  exploration  important  for CB?,"This is the first step  in developing  an application  persona,  which  we can then  build  a profile  around. Without exploring your interests and choosing a majordirection to pursue, the  application persona will be very broad and not compelling."
Will a letter  from  the headmaster  help?,"That depends. When it comes to supplemental application materials, in general less is  more. Universities know exactly what materials they need to evaluate your candidacy,  and thats what they ask for. Teacher recommendations are important as they provide  the context about who you are in the classroom. Counselor recommendations are  important  because  they  provide  universities  an understanding  of how  you fit in your   class and school overall. Any additional or supplemental letters of recommendation  should provide new information or a new perspective that cant be found in the other  letters of recommendation, and some universities may not accept supplemental letters  of recommendation. If your headmaster has a unique understanding of you, your  academics, or your trajectory, then they could absolutely make a strong supplemental  letter of recommendation! If you dont have a specific relationship with the  headmaster, then  their  letter  is unlikely  to make  a significant  difference  in your   applications.  Speak  to your counseling team if you have any questions about the  suitability of asking your headmaster for a letter of recommendation."
Will applying  to summer  programs  increase  my chances  of being  admitted  to the same  school?,The vast majority  of top schools  explicitly  note  that admission  to their  summer  programs  do not impact admission to their undergraduate degree programs.
Will my child  receive  college  credit  for the courses  taken?,"Perhaps!  It depends  on the program.  Some  offer  credit -bearing  courses,  while  others  are  non-credit  enrichment  experiences.  Keep  in mind  that college  admissions  officers  value  learning  and growth, regardless of credit. Having college credit from a pre -college program does not  mean your student can or should apply as a transfer student."
"Will the workshop  cover  different  types  of writing  styles  required  for college   applications, such as personal essays and supplemental essays?","While the class does discuss personal essays in published form, it does not explicitly  focus  on college  essays.  However,  the skills  built  in the course  can be directly  applied  to  all forms of college essays."
Will we be analyzing  and critiquing  each  other's  work?,"You will read  and present  your  work  to the class  weekly  and receive  preliminary  feedback from peers. However, students will not critique each others work."
Will you create  a personalized  school  selection  plan  based  on my child's  specific  circumstances?,"Yes, we will carefully  review  all aspects  of a students  future  college  application  portfolio. This  includes geographic location, GPA, test scores, activities list, major of interest, and potential  for the student to have access to pre -professional opportunities like internships and  research.   For example,  if a US resident,  we will typically  recommend  our students  to apply to at least one  public school located in their state, due to the in -state advantage in acceptance rate often  afforded by these schools."
"Will you help  me analyze  which  schools  are reach,  match,  and safety  schools?","Yes, we ensure we achieve a balanced list of schools for our students, making sure they are   aiming  high  while  also having  backup  options  just in case.  We encourage  students  to explore a  multitude of campuses and to not only rely on the biggest names. It is great to have a school  list that is a mix of both."
"Will you help  students  connect  with  their  target  schools?  For example,  attending   online information sessions or communicating with admissions officers.","We recommend  that students  attend  in-person  and virtual  events  for as many  schools  as will  make sense for them to build a solid idea of their preferences. We dont facilitate AO  communications, but if there is a public -facing email address for a regional AO, and it makes  sense for the student to contact them, we will help them with the drafting of their message."
Will you provide  psychological  counseling?  Help  children  maintain  a positive  attitude?,"We are always looking for ways to help our students and to provide support, guidance,  and help   throughout  their  college  application  process.  While  we are not licensed counselors, we get to  know our students very well and do the best we can to maintain a healthy and positive attitude  during this time. We consistently ask  our students  about  specific  things  we can do to help  them   and provide  an ear to listen to how they are feeling when needed."
Would  AOs prefer  me taking  more  AP courses  than  my peers?,Only  within  the context  of what AP courses are actually offered at your school.
Would  AP Calculus  BC (xx course)  matter  when  applying  to business  (xx major)?,"Not necessarily. However, taking AP Calculus or a high -level, unrelated class (like AP  Biology  even  if you plan  to major  in literature)  demonstrates  to admission  committees  that the student is serious about non -major -related classes; and, therefore, are more  prepared to handle any academic challenge thrown at them. Taking and doing well in  high -level courses is more appealing to admission committees."
Would  it make  me look  bad if both  of my letters  are from  Chinese  teachers?,No! You should  ask for recommendations  from  teachers  who  will best  be able  to speak  to who you are as a student. The ethnicity of the recommender does not play a role in  how the recommendation is evaluated.

What is the Overall To-Do List for 1 School for AC or Application counselling?,"?
Appendix B  Overall To-Do List for 1 School



Heres the average list of the work for 1 school (ED as an example) for a student between the beginning of your work with us and Nov. 1st: 

1.	Attend or Watch AC Orientation Videos (Session 1, Session 2, Session 3, and Session 4) & complete Required section of the Homework assignment prior to first meeting with FAO and GC. (See Appendix B for full Homework details.)

2.	Select your ED school (1 school) and research it thoroughly with your counselors guidance.

3.	Write your Activity & Honors list & incorporate multiple rounds of feedback from your counselors.

4.	Write your personal statement and incorporate multiple rounds of feedback from your counselors.

5.	Write supplemental essays (normally between 1 and 3 essays for an ED school) and incorporate feedback from your counselors.

6.	Fill out the rest of your Common Application, including activities & honors section, as well as additional information / COVID question (if applicable). 

7.	Send all your test scores to schools (TOEFL, SAT, ACT, SAT Subject Tests, AP Exams). If school is test optional, follow your counselors guidance on whether to submit.

8.	Talk to your school guidance counselor about sending your transcript. Note: 9th grade is still middle school in China and South Korea, but U.S. and Canadian high schools include 9th-12th grade. Admissions officers will need to see your 9th through 12th grade transcript. If you repeated 9th grade, they will need to see both 9th grade transcripts. 

9.	Ask teachers for letters of recommendation either before leaving school for summer, or when returning to school in fall. Follow-up and remind teachers, build a strong relationship and share information about yourself with these letter writers, and pay for letter translation and notarization services (if needed). Make sure your teachers submit the letters online. 

10.	If applicable, register for a Third-Party Interview, complete practice interviews with your counselor, and send Third-Party interview videos to your ED school.

11.	Parents and school counselor sign ED agreement. 

12.	Parents prepare the financial certificate (if the ED school asks for it).

13.	Finally, allow time for a comprehensive Final Review from counselors before the application is submitted. For the Final Review, send a PDF of your completed application to your counselors. 

The FAO will provide one round of comprehensive feedback. Then, you will implement all these changes (proactively ask your FAO questions, as needed). After this feedback has been incorporated, your GC will do a Final Check and give you approval to submit the application. "
What should you do if your parents want to write essays for you? ,"Some parents, with the best intentions in the world, want to help their children by writing essays for them. We have seen, time and again, that this is not effective (and, of course, its not ethical either). 

It is obvious to an admissions officer that an adult has written an essay because of the tone and content of the essay (your counselors will likely know as well!). Instead of being a benefit to you, this will be a red flag that the admissions committee will take into consideration in your admissions decision. 

If your parents want to write essays for you, you can talk with them and tell them that this is a process where you want to have ownership, since it is about your college experience, and suggest productive ways for them to be involved, such as brainstorming potential essay content with you, helping you find resources on schools of interest, connecting you to current students / alums of different colleges, etc."
What if you and your parents disagree?,Your counselors are not here to solve your family miscommunications! You and your parents should talk about what you want out of your college experience so that you can advocate for yourself. We will do our best to advocate for you while also meeting your parents expectations.
How can you talk with your parents best? ,"Your parents will likely want to be involved in your application process, and you may have mixed feelings about this. Some students really want their parents to help them, while others want to make sure that this is a process about them. Either way, things will go the most smoothly if you TALK with your parents about what their expectations are and what your expectations are. 

We recommend that you have a check-in with your family at the beginning of the fall semester to make sure you are on the same page. You should continue to check in with your parents, especially about their thoughts on your school list."
When is Counselor/PM Time Off or Counselor/PM Time holidays?,"Counselor/PM time off is important to keep everyone fresh and bright-eyed, especially considering all the reading and editing your team is doing :). The following dates are some of the dates when your counselors and PMs will be offline and unresponsive via WeChat/Whatsapp and email, depending on their location and the holidays we observe. We will remind students about these breaks closer to the date, and your counseling team will make sure you have a clear to-do list before going offline. 

Specific Holidays that Impact the Application Cycle:

Juneteenth (June 19, 2024): Counselors/PMs in the US will be offline on Wednesday, June 19, to commemorate Juneteenth. 

Independence Day (July 4 and 5, 2024): Counselors/PMs in the US will be offline on Thursday, July 4th and Friday, July 5th, to celebrate US Independence Day. Any urgent emails sent on the 4th or 5th will be responded to by the 6th.

Labor Day (September 2nd, 2024): Counselors/PMs in the US will be off on Monday, September 2nd and will return to work on the 3rd. Any messages sent will be responded to by the morning of the 6th in the counselors local time zone.

Post-ED Break (November 2-4): After the Early Decision round of applications are submitted in early November, InGenius counselors/PMs take a much-needed few days off. This is often a good time for students to take a break as well before diving into further application work. 

Please respect this time off and know that they will respond to you as soon as they return from the break. 

Veterans Day (November 11): Counselors/PMs in the US will be offline on November 11 in observance of the holiday.

Thanksgiving (November 28-29, 2024): Counselors/PMs in the US will not work on Thanksgiving or the next day. However, any emails that you send to InGenius counselors on Thursday or Friday will be responded to by Saturday morning in the counselors local time zone.

Christmas (December 24-25): Both Christmas Eve (December 24) and Christmas Day (December 25) are recognized holidays where counselors will be unavailable. However, any emails that you sent to InGenius counselors on the 24th or 25th will be responded to by the morning of the 26th in the counselors local time zone. 

New Years Eve/New Years Day (December 31 - January 1): Counselors will be offline from noon on December 31 through noon on January 1 in their local time zone. It is in your best interest to have all of your applications that are due on January 1 submitted before the holiday!

Note: Counselors/PMs in other countries will be off based on the local national holiday policies. "
What are the Best Practices for Application Counseling?,"?	Check Genie/Email/WeChat regularly & use GROUP communication
ALL communication with your InGenius team should be done within your Google Group, via your account on the Genie platform, or through your WeChat group. Even when you think your email or message is only applicable to one of your counselors, you should always use group communication to ensure that your entire counseling team (FAO, GC, & PM) is updated on your progress. 

Often, you may ask a question to your GC that your FAO is more equipped to answer, or vice versa, so group communication is beneficial to all parties. 

?	Be respectful/polite to your counselors 
Your counselors work very hard on your behalf, especially working very long hours leading up to deadlines. They are also highly educated people who have your best interests at heart. You should always treat your counselors with respect, just like you would for your teachers at school. 

If your counselor isnt meeting your expectations, you can talk with them honestly but politely about what you are hoping to accomplish or how they can better help you.

?	Develop your own independence 
The college admissions process is a time for you to show the colleges of your dreams what YOU can do. We are here to help guide you through the process and help you brainstorm, but the work is ultimately your own. 

If somebody else completes work for you, college admissions teams will often notice a change in a students voice in different essays. Again, the work must be your own!

?	Communicate even if you disagree with your counselor 
Its important to note that your counselors are very talented individuals who either have experience working in an admissions office, or have attended colleges that are fiercely competitive. In other words, they know what they are talking about! 

However, it is understandable that you may have other ideas about what you can write about in your essays, or you might change your mind about how you feel about writing about certain topics. In these cases, you should share your feelings and explain why you think your alternatives are better. Successful communication will ensure that everyone is on the same page and moving forward together. Our counselors are more than happy to accommodate your feelings, as we dont want anybody to be uncomfortable!

?	Attend (and be on time for!) all meetings with your counselors  
At the beginning of the application season, students will meet with their Graduate Coach (GC) and Former Admissions Officer (FAO) to get to know each other. After that, students will meet with their GC about once per week for the next 5 weeks (for a total of 6 weekly meetings), while their FAO provides guidance from the sidelines. 

FAOs will also join calls in which students solidify their college list and their essay topics. Once the weekly meetings have been completed , students and counselors will transition to biweekly meetings and will be able to do much more of their work through written feedback, so students will have less frequent meetings with their GC.

Students should provide at least 24 hours written notice for any cancellations of appointments with InGenius counselors. Any student shall be considered to have missed a meeting without advanced notice if the student does not join the meeting within 15 minutes of the scheduled time. Missed meetings  will not be made up on a different date.

?	Complete homework and adhere to deadlines 
You should complete your homework for your counselor at least 24 hours before your meeting time or by the due date your counselor set (whichever is earlier). 

If you get your homework to your counselor ahead of time, that means that youll be able to get more done during the meeting!

Students are responsible for checking their emails, especially any notifications in their university application portals, and submitting your applications by the time of the deadline.


?	Follow logistic details to ensure efficient & effective communication

?	You should name your documents with your NAME, TITLE, and DATE. For example, Harry Potter would title his document: 

Harry Potter Duke Supplement 7/30/23

?	If you are working on UK applications, please name all UK application documents by starting the title with UK. See how Harry would do it:

UK: Harry Potter Personal Statement 7/30/23

?	Use your Google Drive folder as the central place where you keep all documents related to Application Counseling. 

Add all of your documents here and remember to name them as described above."
What can you expect from InGenius if you have delayed your work? ,"InGenius wants to support you as much as we can in the days leading up to your deadline. However, if you have not shown investment in your work as we approach deadlines, your counseling team may no longer have the capacity to support you in your applications. We will also send warning letters to you and your parents.

Here is what you can expect from us if you have: 
a) Missed 3 meetings in a row 
b) Have not completed any assignments for 3 weeks without explanation or asking questions for clarifications OR 
c) Have not communicated anything to your counselors in more than 3 weeks without explanation:

Within 2 weeks of a deadline: 
?	Our team of backup editors will work on essay edits for you, and you can expect essays turned around in 2-3 days.
Within 1 week of a deadline: 
?	Our team of backup editors will work on essay edits for you, and you can expect essays turned around in 1-2 days.
Within 48 hours of a deadline: 
?	At this point, we will no longer offer a final review on your materials, but we can give you 1 round of feedback, which may be done by any counselor or backup editor on the InGenius team. "
What can you expect from InGenius in the final days leading up to the deadline? ,"If you send your FR 3+ days before deadline:
?	Your FAO will perform a thorough final review of your whole application (for EA/ED) and supplemental essays (RD). You will receive an email with feedback. It will take 24-72 hours to receive this feedback.
?	You will take your FAOs feedback and revise your application based on their feedback. 
?	For any higher-level feedback, your GC will help you implement the changes that your FAO recommended and approve you to submit your application. 

If you send your FR 1-2 days before the deadline:
?	Your FAO will do their best to review, but your material may need to go to someone else on the InGenius education team due to time constraints
?	You will have very limited time to address any feedback
?	Your GC will have almost no time to double check that FAO feedback was fully addressed. Your GC will check to make sure you dont have any typos and have addressed feedback from the FAO.
?	You are likely to submit your application on the day of the deadline (risking website crashing and other potential issues).

If you send your FR on the day of the deadline:
?	Your FAO will not be able to complete a full final review. Your materials are likely to go to someone else on the InGenius education team due to time constraints.
?	You will only receive feedback on grammar and typos. You will not receive content editing feedback.
?	You will have no time for GC Approval.
?	You will likely be submitting your application within hours of the deadline (risking website crashing and other potential issues).
?	If you need support in the submission process, your team  may not be available at the moment you press submit.
?	If you send any application materials within 3 hours of the deadline, your materials wont get reviewed at all."
What can you do if you are experiencing stress or challenges with your mental wellbeing? ,"We know that the application season is incredibly stressful for students and families. You may be dealing with lots of high expectations from many different places, including yourself. "
What should you do if you feel like you need a pause from application counseling? ,"You should communicate with your counselor and say that you need a break. You and your counseling team should decide on the length of the break so you can create a plan together on how best to catch up on your work when you resume application counseling. 

Its never helpful for you to simply disappear from your counseling team without any notice: you could fall behind and/or lose your counseling team. We want to ensure we can support you if you need a break, so please communicate so we can help you catch up."
What kind of support can you expect from your counselors regarding mental health? ,"Your counseling team are admissions counselors, not counselors trained in mental health. Your counseling team wants to give you emotional support but we cannot professionally give you advice regarding how to handle mental health diagnoses. 

You should make sure that you know a professional counselor or psychologist at your school or local community whom you can contact if/when you need additional support.

Additionally, ALL IGP students have access to one month of free therapy (up to four live sessions) with a therapist through Better Help/Teen Counseling. You can visit this website and use the access code 1ae77 to start the intake process any time. 

InGenius Prep will have NO information on whether you actually pursue care through BetterHelp and CANNOT access any information you provide to BetterHelp. We are by no means promoting BetterHelps services over other care providers, nor are we profiting from this opportunity. We are simply providing this additional resource in the hopes that it can help improve access to professional emotional and mental health support if or when IGP students need it."
What are the procedures for Pause in Application Counseling Service?,"If you choose to take a pause from working with InGenius for whatever reason, you can extend your AC package for one year but you will not be entitled to a refund. 

If you pause, you can return to working with us at the same date in the following calendar year (i.e. if you pause service in October, you can resume service in October of the following year) to complete the remaining work that you didnt complete in the original year. 

You are not eligible to pause after November 1 (in this case, you would forfeit your remaining service). 

You will only be able to extend the package for a maximum of one year, and there will be no guarantee that you could work with the same counseling team when you return. "
Is there any Art/Music Portfolios available in AC or Application Counseling ?,Not included in any package.
Is there any Financial Aid support available in AC or Application Counseling ?,Not included in any package.
How to add Additional Schools  in AC or Application Counseling ?,Students may add more schools to their package on or before December 5th
Is there any scholarship support available in AC or Application Counseling ?,"InGenius Application Counseling services do not help with external scholarship applications or scholarships within a schools application. If you want to apply to scholarships with extra essays, you may count that scholarship application as a school on your list (it will count as a reach school) or purchase a separate scholarship application package.  "
BS/MD Programs,Students who are interested in applying to BS/MD programs can either upgrade to a package that offers support for 3 schools and their BS/MD applications for an extra cost OR convert 2 regular schools on your list with us to count as 1 BS/MD program (and those programs are always considered reaches). 
Special Program Application Support,"For students applying to specialized programs with extra essays (outside of BS/MD programs), such as film/architecture/studio art/music programs, we can help with up to 1 extra essay required by this specialized program per school you are applying to, for up to 3 total extra essays. If the special program application requires more than 1 extra essay outside of the colleges regular essays or there are more than 3 extra essays total, then it will need to count as an additional school on your package with InGenius."
How is Interview prep  or Interview preparation in application counseling or AC?,"Your counselors will help prepare you for your first interview by doing interview preparation exercises. You will then have the opportunity to conduct a mock interview with an interviewer you dont know and receive feedback.

Once youve prepared and conducted your mock interview, you should be able to use what you learned to do a great job in all of your interviews. Each student is allowed up to two (2) mock interviews (ideally one for the EA/ED round, and one for RD). You wont need to do a separate mock interview for each interview you schedule."
How many Safety/Target/Reach schools should I have on my list for AC? ,"In order to ensure that your college applications are successful, we have implemented several policies to help maximize your results. Please refer to the following guidelines regarding how many schools you should apply to in each categoryReach, Target, and Safetybased on the Application Counseling (AC) package you have purchased:

For the 5-school package, you should apply to 4 reach schools and 1 target school. Safety schools are not explicitly required, but materials should be adapted as needed.

For the 8-school package, you should apply to 5 reach schools and 3 target schools. As with the 5-school package, safety schools are not a fixed requirement, but materials should be adapted accordingly.

For the 10-school package, you should apply to 5 reach schools (including 1 reach for the moon school), 3 target schools, and 2 safety schools.

For the 12-school package, you should apply to 6 reach schools (including 1 reach for the moon school), 4 target schools, and 2 safety schools.

For the 15-school package, you should apply to 7 reach schools (including 2 reach for the moon schools), 5 target schools, and 3 safety schools.

For the US + UK school package, you should apply to 5 reach schools and 3 target schools divided between the US and the UK, plus 1 US and 1 UK safety school. Alternatively, you may opt for 2 US safety schools and none in the UK, depending on your preferences.

For UK-only packages, you should apply to 2 reach schools, 2 target schools, and 1 safety school within the UK."
What counts as Safety/Target/Reach schools on my list? ,"While some schools are a Reach for some and a Target for others, it is important to note that any school with less than a 15% admission rate is considered a Reach for ALL who apply. InGenius counselors will not approve any school list that DOES NOT have at least 2 Safety Schools and 2 Target Schools. 

If a student does not agree to a school list approved by both counselors, the student and family must sign an official agreement (see Appendix C) acknowledging that they are explicitly going against the advice of the InGenius counselors. 	For students on all 5-school packages and 8-school packages, we recommend that students select several Target and Safety schools in addition to their school list with InGenius. Since you will reuse a lot of the materials you work on with your InGenius counselors to apply to schools on your own, we ask that you share those results with InGenius as well for our record and data collection purposes."
What if I want to apply to schools outside of the US? ,"If you are on the 10-school package & 12-school package  (and haven't purchased an additional AC package) you can choose to apply to a maximum of 2 non-US schools with InGenius' help. Schools in non-US countries/regions we can currently help with include: Canada, Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong. 

The remaining 8 or 10 US schools must have a minimum of 2 Safety and 2 Target schools. Our counselors will NOT determine the Safety/Target/Reach category of the non-US schools you select, and we can help with any 2 non-US schools of your choice. 

If you want to apply to schools in the UK (i.e. Cambridge / Oxford, etc.), you need to upgrade your package to work with our UK counselors. With this upgrade, you will have an additional UK-specific counselor to work with you on the UK applications in addition to your US team.  If you plan to apply for Oxford or Cambridge, you will need to upgrade before the end of August; if you dont plan to apply for Oxford or Cambridge, you will need to upgrade before the end of December. "
What Qualifies as a Safety School? ,"For US Colleges/Universities: 
Broadly speaking, for applicants currently based in the US, a school can be considered a Safety school if a students academic credentials (a combination of GPA, SAT or ACT, AP and TOEFL scores) fall above the school's mid 50% range for the average freshman. 

For applicants currently based in Asia, a school can be considered a Safety School if a students academic credentials are higher than the 75th percentile. Most safety schools will have an acceptance rate above 50%. 

Your counselors will be helping you define your school list proportions based on your individual profile, but you should expect your counselors to follow these guidelines. 

If you dont have an SAT score yet this year, your academic credentials will be assessed based primarily on your GPA and any other standardized tests that you DO have.

NOTE: Schools with lower than 30% acceptance rates cannot be safety schools in any circumstances.

For UK Universities:
Reach:  An aspirational or dream choice that will be challenging to achieve.  Usually a university where you are expecting to achieve exactly the minimum entry requirements, or a G5 university.

Target:  A strong choice where you are more-likely-than-not to be accepted. A university where you are certain to meet or exceed the minimum requirements.

Safety: A good choice where you are very likely to be accepted.  A university where you are certain you will comfortably exceed the minimum requirements.

NOTE:  G5, St. Andrews and Durham cannot be safety schools in any circumstances."
How is  School List Changes in AC?,"We understand that it is a big decision to select where you are going to live and study for the next 4 years. Thus, we are supportive of students decisions to add or omit schools from their lists. We recommend that students finalize their EA/ED school choices by September 15 and RD/EDII school choices by November 15th so that they have enough time to prepare great supplemental essays. After November 15th, however, your school list is considered finalized, and you cannot alter your list.

If there is a significant change to your applications, such as access to new and notably different test scores or acceptances from EA/ED applications, you may consult your counselors about changing your school list slightly. For example, if you are accepted to early schools, you may choose to not apply to any additional safety schools during the regular decision round. 

If you are rejected from ALL of your EA/ED schools, we will help you change / add 1-2 safety schools. We strongly urge students to refrain from the temptation to make substantial changes to their applications (for example, restarting their personal statements), even in this situation. 

We understand that rejections can be difficult to face but we also want to reassure students to trust the hard work they have put into their applications. Every year, we see students with disappointing early round results receive much better news for their regular decision applications without making changes to the application materials. It is very, very unlikely that a rejection is due to a students personal statement. Instead, you should focus your energy on completing RD supplemental essays. 

As soon as a counselor has started giving you feedback on a supplemental essay, that school is officially on your list and counts as one of your schools with InGenius. 

Our final deadline for adding a school is December 5th. If you add any schools after December 5th, you may or may not have the ability to work with your current counseling team. A team of backup counselors / editors may work with you on these additional applications."

Counselor Roles,"For most students, you are working with at least two counselors in the Candidacy Building and/or Application Counseling process. So who is supposed to do what? Here is how we describe the relationship between GC and FAO: 

""Think of the university application process as a mission to a new world. Having been through the journey many times before, your GC is your personal astronaut, guiding you closely, through thick and thin, as you navigate the challenges that lie ahead. Your FAO is ground control. Unlike the GC, the FAO is not there with you aboard the spacecraft, but their perspective back on Earth provides you with the best strategy and high level feedback so that you stay on course and achieve your mission in triumph. Each has the same goal in mind; each has a different perspective that can best help you succeed.""

?	Your GC will serve as your main contact, with whom you will have regular  meetings. In addition, your GC will help guide you as you explore your interests, build your profile, and perform edits on up to three (3) summer program applications.  During the college application counseling process, your GC will help you conduct research on schools, check up on schedules/deadlines, and perform close edits on all aspects of your application, including your Activities List, Personal Statement, and Supplemental Essays. Your GC will help you stay organized by sending out reports with homework assignments after each meeting. 

?	Your FAO will provide high-level guidance and strategy for the development of your profile, including elements like course selection, standardized testing, application persona, summer planning, utilizing InGenius resources, school list, and strategies for your college applications, etc.  Think of your FAO as someone who will provide high-level guidance for your journey.

?	Your Progress Manager (if applicable) will relay and explain the advice received from your InGenius counseling team, but are not responsible to give direct counseling advice. The usual office hours for Progress Managers are 9:00 to 18:00, with the time zone determined by the location of the Progress Manager. With the exception of emergency circumstances (as determined by InGenius), students and families agree to respect the general guideline that they should contact Progress Managers only during office hours."
Offline Meeting with Counselors,"Occasionally, you may happen to visit the same city / town as one of your InGenius counselors. If you would like to try meeting them in-person, please reach out as early as possible. If your counselors schedule allows, they may agree to meeting in-person, but you should not expect that your counselor would definitely be able to accommodate your request, as this is not within our standard scope of service.  "
Change of Counselors and Progress Managers,"Remember that your counselors and Progress Managers are real people, and life happens! There is always a possibility that your counseling team will change during the course of your time at InGenius. In the occasional instance where this does happen, InGenius has developed comprehensive transition plans to make sure your new counselors understand your profile if you do need to switch counseling teams."
Meeting Policies ,"Students should provide at least 24 hours written notice for any cancellations of appointments with InGenius counselors. Any student shall be considered to have missed a meeting if the student does not give 24 hours notice or join the meeting within 15 minutes of the scheduled time.  

If you cancel a meeting within 24 hours of the scheduled time or miss it entirely, the counselor will reschedule the meeting in the following week. If the counselors schedule is full in your time preferences the following week, it may take up to two weeks to reschedule.

If a student misses 2 scheduled meetings within 1 month, you forfeit a CB meeting for that month. If you miss 3 meetings within a calendar year, you forfeit a CB meeting for that year and your candidacy building progress will be delayed as a result.

Due to the more time sensitive nature of the College Application Counseling stage, it may not be possible to make up meetings a student misses. Repeatedly missing AC meetings can result in the student falling behind in their application progress, leading to less time to develop and edit a strong application. In addition, official warning letters will be sent to students and parents for missing 3 meetings in a row.

InGenius Prep reserves the right to record all meetings for quality assurance purposes."
Communication Policies,"ALL communication with your InGenius team should be done within your Google Group, via your account on the Genie platform, or through your WeChat group. Even when you think your email or message is only applicable to one of your counselors, you should always use group communication to ensure that your entire counseling team (FAO, GC, & PM) is updated on your progress. 

Often, you may ask a question to your GC that your FAO is more equipped to answer, or vice versa, so group communication is beneficial to all parties. 
In addition, you must check email and all other relevant electronic communication accounts and application portals frequently and forward any correspondence from colleges/universities/summer programs to InGenius to ensure that no deadlines or opportunities to submit additional information are missed. You bear all responsibilities for missing important notices or messages from applied-to programs and schools."
Parent Involvement,"Our goal at InGenius Prep is to help you develop as a young adult, learning the skills you need to succeed in your education journey, like independence and taking initiative.  We want to make sure we can focus on building our relationship with YOU and working with you to make that happen. For these reasons, we ask that parents are not present in meetings. Your parents will get regular updates about your work with us, and you should also talk with them so that theyre aware of your progress with us. 

During your Candidacy Building service years, your parents are invited to join the Candidacy Building Strategy Meeting with you and your counselors. They are welcome to share their questions and concerns ahead of the meeting so your counselors can address them during the meeting. Additionally, your parents are invited to the annual Candidacy Building Strategy Meeting with you and your counselors. "
